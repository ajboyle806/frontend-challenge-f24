Students will typically work in pairs.  Section 1: Programmed Matter: Introduces students to a generative approach to digital design and robotic manufacturing with the goal of unifying design and production within one creative process. The studio will commence with students gaining first-hand experience programming and operating Penn's industrial robots. 3d design models will be developed in parallel to fabrication experiments and digital simulations. The design brief will focus on a small scale design prototype that is explored at a micro-scale of resolution relative to normative architectural practice. Material placement and material affect will be considered intrinsic to design expression and integral to considerations of space, form, structure and production concerns. The brief will focus on a small scale object or architectural part design with ornamental features. The course introduces material dynamics, robot programming, 3d modelling and computer programming within design.  Section 2: Manipulative Matter explores both robotic fabrication and the use of sensors and actuators within responsive fabricated objects or architectural elements. Design Prototyping involving manipulation-based Manufacture. Eg. Sheet metal folding. This will complement the first studio by requiring more pre-determined design intent, fabrication rationalization and robot sensor and electrical integration. A final design prototype will demonstrate embodied material intelligence - through an integrative approach to material organization, electronic circuity, production and design. Electronic wiring and parts will be integrated within larger material prototypes through fabrication methods such as: inlays, additive manufacturing, casting, soldering, painting, laser-cutting, or milling.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"ARAB-0100","title":"Elementary Arabic I","description":"This is the beginners course in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).

This course is open to graduate students only.\nThis graduate seminar breaks down the traditional art historical category \u201cmetalwork\u201d into its component parts\u2014metal and work\u2014to propose that each of these terms provides a methodological framework from which to approach the study of this medium. Upheld in pre-modern periods for both its material worth and the technical expertise required to craft its raw matter into forms, metalwork in the modern era was relegated to the margins of the discipline as one of the \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cdecorative\u201d arts. A few factors now stimulate renewed study of pre-modern metalwork. While the material turn has called for recognition of the inherent properties of precious alloy and histories of scientific and pseudo-scientific epistemologies study alchemical attempts to produce gold, the object of this course is to focus on the varieties of labour required for this most resource intensive art form. We will consider period efforts to source expensive and difficult to unearth materials (gold, silver, gems, etc.) as well as the politics of organizing such extractive methods. We will examine technical practices, from filigree to casting massive bronze, which demand advanced skill, take their toll on the body, and consume environmental resources. By taking the medieval and early modern periods as our focus, we probe the status of these demanding objects at a time before painting became synonymous with \u201cart.\u201d Topics will include: mining and metalworking techniques, the organization of craft guilds, trade in raw materials, political philosophies of resource allocation, as well as the provisioning of labour across these economies, both free and un-free. \n\nWe propose centering our discussions around the extraordinary collections and intact industrial history of Prague, Kutn\u00e1 Hora, and Karlstein castle, and the course will be organized around travel to these sites. The silver mine of Kutn\u00e1 Hora, and the taler there produced (antecedent for the North American dollar), financed the imperial and artistic ambitions of the Holy Roman Empire.

In our current world, this means the world of digital culture, but what led to this was a blending of technologies and material culture that we would not always consider as \"technological.\" The cultural practices that go along with these technologies are invariably not visible to us without interrogation: the ways technological usage shapes and is shaped by the cultures that create them, as well as how technologies shape and are shaped by other cultures that adopt them. Oftentimes, technology tools practices are translated in ways that their creators never envisioned, and take on meanings that shift dramatically. Across time, even within a single culture, technology means very different things from one era to the next. Examples include the roles of basic tools like glass, to complex tools like audio tape. In DIGC 1600, students will explore and develop an understanding of contemporary digital culture based on the idea that media and information technologies operate in a cycle of constant dialogue with the communities and modes of cultural practice that surround them. Using case studies of technological innovation and transformation, we'll examine the political and social impacts of what has become our contemporary digital culture through the resulting material culture objects we use every day. Students will be encouraged to explore from their own experiences how they interact with, create, and understand technocultural objects in their active and living world from an interdisciplinary, social science-based perspective, drawing from disciplines across the humanities and social sciences. Some of the guiding questions for the course include: How do we understand something as a \"new\" technology? How can we analyze the ways that members of a culture use technology as a locus for evolving or conflicting cultural practices and social change? And, how does culture affect our understanding of a technology and how we use it? Readings will consist of articles and book chapters provided in the course Canvas site.

It aims at building an understanding of landscapes as both physical spaces and as cultural media and constructions that sit at the nexus between art and science and that contribute knowledge about humankind's relationship with non-human nature. Landscapes are the result of social, political, artistic and intellectual endeavors. The topography, soil and climate of a site also condition its design, use and habitation. As much as designed and found landscapes are a product of their time, they have also contributed to shaping history, both through their physical materiality and through the mental worlds they enable. Embedding found and designed landscapes into their social, political and cultural contexts, the course also pays close attention to the role of expert knowledge and the professions that have contributed to creating them. The course explores the various tensions and relationships embodied, created and represented by designed landscapes; the tensions between nature and culture, practice and use, design and reception, the visual reception of landscapes and their inhabitation, and site-specificity and purposefully \"international\" design expressions.

How have their connections to politics changed? What has this meant for the fortunes and strategies of the two parties? How have the parties' base voters and swing voters changed? What changes in American society have advantaged some political messages and parties at the expense of others? Focusing primarily on mass-level politics, we consider a wide range of potential causes, including the role of race in American politics, suburbanization, economic transformations, the evolving constellation and structure of interest groups, declining social capital, the changing role of religion, immigration, and the actions of parties and political elites.

How does it differ from science, religion, literature, and other modes of human discourse? This course traces the origins of philosophy as a discipline in the Western tradition, looking to thinkers of Ancient Greece and Rome. We will examine how natural philosophers such as Thales, Anaximander, and Heraclitus distinguished their inquiries from the teachings of poets such as Homer and Hesiod; how ancient atomism had its origins in a response to Parmenides' challenge to the assumption that things change in the world; how Socrates reoriented the focus of philosophy away from the natural world and toward the fundamental ethical question, how shall I live? We will also examine how his pupil, Plato, and subsequently Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems that address the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness. Finally, we will examine the ways in which later thinkers such as the Epicureans and Stoics transformed and extended the earlier tradition.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":3.11,"instructor_quality":3.27,"difficulty":1.963,"work_required":1.957,"credits":1.0},{"id":"REAL-3960","title":"Real Estate Entrepreneur","description":"This half-semester course will focus on entrepreneurial aspects of the real estate investment business.

Studio problems are \"live\" - local leaders and experts are actively trying to solve them, there is an audience for student work outside the University, and projects have the potential to stimulate debate and new directions. The Green Stimuli studio takes on design problems where soil, terrain, geology, mineral resources, climate, water, plants, wildlife, and living systems interactions are major drivers. Studio projects explore one or more of these dimensions in depth to reach high levels of design exploration, strategic thinking, technical resolution and physical expression. The studio's topics intersect with a broader universe of practical concerns, including land use, local and regional economies, real estate development and public policy, as well as philosophical and artistic questions about nature and ecology. The intent is that designed Green Stimuli make new connections between the material of landscape and the economic, infrastructural, scientific, social, cultural and creative attributes of a region.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":2.0},{"id":"PHIL-1840","title":"Intro Cognitive Science","description":"How do minds work?

Scholars have been recently asked questions about loss of public faith in the process of democracy, elites engaging and supporting behaviors that are anti-democratic, and crucially, what the reasons for these mass-level shifts in support for the democratic system. In this course, we will give attention to three key topics that will shed light these processes. First, what is democratic erosion? How should we think about it? Can we historically contextualize our moment relative to other moments in American history? Second, we will give specific attention to racial threat from the changing demography of the U.S. as a cause for erosion. Where might these ideas come from? Is threat driven from the public or elites? Does it stack up as a problem for American democracy versus other forms of threat? Third, how ought we study and think about the 2024 Election? Does it give indicators for future elections? Students who take this course will learn both theoretically and empirically how to better evaluate and think of the processes of democracy in the midst of shifting support for the system.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":3.181,"instructor_quality":3.355,"difficulty":2.703,"work_required":2.975,"credits":1.0},{"id":"SAST-1730","title":"Intro to Buddhism","description":"This course seeks to introduce students to the diversity of doctrines held and practices performed by Buddhists in Asia.

Religion is never divorced from its place and its time. Furthermore, by geographically and historically grounding the study of these religions we will be able to examine how their individual ethic, cosmological and soteriological systems effect local history, economics, politics, and material culture. We will concentrate first on the person of the Buddha, his many biographies and how he has been followed and worshipped in a variety of ways from Lhasa, Tibet to Phrae, Thailand. From there we touch on the foundational teachings of the Buddha with an eye to how they have evolved and transformed over time. Finally, we focus on the practice of Buddhist ritual, magic and ethics in monasteries and among aly communities in Asia and even in the West. This section will confront the way Buddhists have thought of issues such as \"Just-War,\" Women's Rights and Abortion.

The ascent of extreme nationalists and nationalism in other power centers in the world along with growing distrust in government and public institutions may have marked the close of the two-decade post 9\/11 era. Indeed, the global COVID-19 pandemic and the ways in which actors across the international spectrum have responded (or failed to respond) has led many to question the assumptions inherent in the post-9\/11 international order and has marked the beginning of a new era of competition, a return to great-power politics, and the diminishing power of traditional actors, systems, and ideals on the global stage. This course will provide students with an in-depth, practical analysis of foreign policy and foreign policy making, with a view from Washington. It will also provide a baseline global literacy, through the lens of emerging ideas, institutions, interests, and actors, and focus on a framework for understanding shifts already underway in how Washington views the world. We will utilize less traditional resources, and instead focus on practical and \"real-world\" course material as well as less traditional instruction methods - utilizing and  analyzing the sources and resources that policy makers in Washington rely upon. These include long-form journalism, official government documents, hearings and Congressional debate, think tank products, and news sources. Students will have the opportunity to engage with a variety of guest-speakers, all of whom have held senior official and non-governmental roles in American foreign policy making and influencing.

In answering these questions we draw on a variety of case studies, from historical examples of early globalization (e.g. The Atlantic and Indian Ocean Worlds, global flows of conspicuous commodities such as sugar, coffee, and tea, the rise and transformations of early capitalism), to issues facing our current globalized world (e.g. mass-mediatization and multilingualism, border regimes and international migration, planetary urbanization). The body of the course deals with particular dimensions of globalization, reviewing both the early and recent history of each. The overall approach is historical and comparative, setting globalization on the larger stage of the economic, political and cultural development of various parts of the modern world. The course is taught by anthropologists who draw from economic, linguistic, sociocultural, archaeological, and historical perspectives, offering the opportunity to compare and contrast distinct disciplinary approaches.

We therefore explore the nature of the interactions. What was the history of therapeutic practices that originated in Africa or South Asia? How did European medical practices change in the colonies? What were the effects of colonial racial and gender hierarchies on medical practice? How did practitioners of \"non-Western\" medicine carve out places for themselves? How did they redefine ancient traditions? How did patients find their way among multiple therapeutic traditions?

The course material provides an overview of feminist theories as they have developed in Western and non-Western contexts, over the last two hundred years (though there is particular emphasis on the period since the 1960s), thus positioning feminism beyond the West in terms of global and transnational perspectives.  It places works and scholars in conversation with others, both contemporaries who act and speak from other standpoints and predecessors who belong to the same tradition or trajectory.    The organization of the course responds to the inadequacy of previous categories (liberal feminism, Marxist feminism, etc.) that do not encompass the complexity of feminist thought from the perspective of the early 21st century, given the impact of intersectionality, queer studies, globalization, political backlash, authoritarianism, and so on.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"ARAB-6100","title":"Elementary Arabic I","description":"This is the beginners course in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).

In fact the concepts of modern art and homosexuality that we use today are twins, for they were both founded in the third quarter of the 19th century and grew up together. Introduction to Queer Art thus begins with the coining of the word \"homosexual\" in 1869, and surveys how a range of mediums including painting, sculpture, poetry, music, and film shifted in response to new definitions of sexuality. Along the way, we will work towards answering two related questions: 1) Why were queer creators largely responsible for the introduction of modernity in the arts, and 2) why do we find so often that queer social and political dissent found form in, and as, aesthetic dissent as well? In creating new forms for art that often seem far removed from any traditional definition of sexuality, including non-objective and abstract art, queer artists pushed the boundaries of normativity, leading to new ways of seeing, hearing, feeling and thinking that often dared to encode queer meanings as part of their formal innovation. We will look into the politics of queer art, and how and why in the US, even amidst often dangerous homophobia, it was queer artists who represented America to itself. Thus, we will cover such key cultural figures such as Walt Whitman, Gertrude Stein, Georgia O'Keeffe, Frank O'Hara, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, and Agnes Martin. Throughout, new methods informed by queer, gender, and critical race theory will be utilized.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":3.575,"instructor_quality":3.54,"difficulty":2.49,"work_required":2.245,"credits":1.0},{"id":"CIMS-1002","title":"Introduction to Media Studies","description":"This course introduces students to the critical study of media \u2013 from social media and smart technologies of today to the audio transmissions and stone carvings of our predecessors.

Subsequent lectures build on this background to explore the science of vaccines for diverse pathogens, including agents of bioterrorism, as well as vaccines and immunotherapies for cancer. An appreciation for the application of laboratory science to the clinical development and clinical trials of vaccines are provided. An important focus on the regulatory, safety, and ethical implications of vaccines in different world situations based on true world examples are presented. The financial implications of specific vaccines with these implications for global health is a focus of the course. The course is presented in a lecture-style consisting of multiple distinguished guest lecturers who are experts in their particular area of vaccine development. There are required readings to provide the student context and background for the diverse lectures. Students are graded on course participation and a final project\/exam which the students will present. The project is to design a vaccine strategy for a current disease or pathogen of importance that does not as yet have an effective vaccine or immune therapy and present this to the class. Strategies used should build on the material presented in the class lectures. The course is intended for graduate students or medical students in various MS, Ph.D., or MD\/Ph.D. programs on the campus, as well as local scientists and professionals in the community. As a prerequisite, students should have taken biology, biochemistry, or immunology courses at the advanced college level. This course is offered in the fall semester.

Throughout, students are introduced to new writing situations as a means of sharpening their skills and learning how to be adaptive, effective writers.\nFrom healthcare inaccessibility to environmental crises and the unhoused, \"the crisis of care\" reveals interdependent strains on people and the systems meant to sustain their needs. The common element uniting these issues is care: given and received, intimate and planetary, observed and ignored. In this seminar, we will examine the politics of care by asking, quite literally, \"Who cares?\" and \"Who cares for whom?\" Through our reading of The Care Manifesto, a collaboratively authored text by a group of scholars and activists called The Care Collective, we will consider the work that goes into caring for ourselves, for others, and for the planet. What does this work consist of, who performs it, and why? Students will have the opportunity to interrogate the liberatory potential of self-care, as well as its reinforcement of social stratification, inequity, and alienation. \"We live in a world where carelessness reigns,\" the Collective writes, \"but it does not have to be this way.\" ","prerequisites":"","course_quality":2.36,"instructor_quality":3.086,"difficulty":2.544,"work_required":3.41,"credits":1.0},{"id":"ANTH-5805","title":"Ruins and Reconstruction","description":"This class examines our enduring fascination with ruins coupled with our commitments to reconstruction from theoretical, ethical, socio-political and practical perspectives.

We will also survey other bio-spiritual practices, such as the meditational techniques of Inner Alchemy and the self-cultivation regimens known today as Qigong and Tai-chi, as well as the theological and ritual foundations of organized Daoist lineages, many of which are still alive across East Asia. We will conclude with a critical review of the twentieth-century reinvention of \"Daoism,\" the scientization of Inner Alchemy, and the new classification of \"religious\" versus \"philosophical Daoism.\" While familiarizing ourselves with the key concepts, practices, and organizations developed in the history of Daoism, this course emphasizes the specific socio-political context of each of them.

In the premodern West, when legal status was often determined by religious affiliation and the state of one\u2019s soul was a deathly serious matter, such changes were even more fraught. What led a person to undertake an essential transformation of identity that could affect everything from food to family to spiritual fulfillment?  Whether we are speaking of individual conversions of conscience or the coerced conversions of whole peoples en masse, religious change has been central to the global development and spread of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, and reveals much about the people and contexts in which it took place.\nThis seminar will explore the dynamics of conversion across a range of medieval and early modern contexts. We will investigate the motivations for conversions, the obstacles faced by converts, and the issues raised by conversion from the perspective of those who remained within a single tradition. How did conversion efforts serve globalization and empire, and what other power relations were involved? How did peoplehood, nationality, or race play out in conversion and its aftermath? How did premodern people understand conversion differently from each other, and differently than their coreligionists or scholars do today? The course will treat a number of specific examples, including autobiographical conversion narratives and conversion manuals, the role ascribed to conversion in visions of messianic redemption, forced conversions under Spanish and Ottoman rule, missionizing in the age of European expansion, and more.\nThe course aims to hone students\u2019 skills in thinking about\u2014and with\u2014premodern religiosity, opening up new perspectives on the past and present by reading primary texts and analytical research.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"ENGL-7155","title":"Boethius - Late Antiq to Mod","description":"This seminar will explore the medieval and early modern reception of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy, through literary imitations and translations, commentaries, and literary responses.

We will spend the first few weeks reading and digesting the Consolation itself, working between the Latin text and an English translation (probably using the Loeb edition). Knowledge of Latin is not required for the course, but the readings will provide ample opportunities for you to work on and with Latin as you wish. When we have read the Consolation we will explore its reception history. This will include medieval vernacular receptions (moving from early texts such as the Old English Boethius to its many appearances in Old French and Middle French, in Middle English especially in the form of Chaucer's Boece, and in any other language traditions that students want to cover); some of the remarkable commentaries on the text, and the later medieval literary apotheosis of the Consolation in Chaucer's Troilus and the \"Boethian lyrics,\" in Thomas Usk's Testament of Love, in Hoccleve's Regiment of Princes, and in early modern texts, including--spectacularly--the translation of the Consolation by Queen Elizabeth 1.

Bodies have long been the mainstay of art, but the attribution of sex to those bodies is a highly variable social phenomenon that tells us as much about the culture in question as it does about ourselves. Sex is thus in the eye of the beholder, defined by cultural, religious, scientific, and political norms, themselves often defined in and through a politics of visibility and exhibition. Beginning in the ancient world and moving into the present, this course studies the sexual politics of display, inherent but little studied, in the history of art history. From Renaissance battles over fig leaves to Enlightenment Europe\u2019s titillation at what they saw as the unbridled eroticism of the ancient world to the culture wars of today, sex has long been a hidden motor of shifts in the art world. Whether coming to understand the so-called \u201cFree Body Culture\u201d of turn of the 20th century Europe with its very public nudity,  to the explosion in nude performance in the 1960s to the culture wars of the 1980s in the USA  over an art that addressed queerness, AIDS, and their intersection, we\u2019ll see  how often exhibitions have served as proxy for other social and political issues.

Is early Rus a mother state of Russia or of Ukraine, and, therefore, should it be spelled \u2018Kyivan Rus,\u2019 or \u2018Kievan Rus\u2019 in English? Has the culture of Russian political despotism been inherited from the Mongols, or is it an autochthonous ideology? The constructed past has a continuing importance in modern Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, and it is keenly referenced, often manipulatively, in contemporary social and political discourse. For example, President Putin invaded Ukraine under a pretense that its territory has \u201calways\u201d been an integral part of Russia and its history.\nThe course covers eight centuries of cultural, political, and social history of the lands that are now within the borders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, from early historical records through the 18th century, a period that laid the foundation for the Russian Empire and the formation of modern nations. Students gain knowledge about formative events and prominent figures, as well as social and cultural developments during this period.\nThe course takes multidisciplinary approach by combining the study of textual sources, objects of art and architecture, music, ritual, and film in their social and historical contexts. Students learn to analyze and interpret primary sources (historical documents and literary texts), identify their intellectual issues, and understand the historical, cultural, and social contexts in which these sources emerged. While working with these primary sources students learn to pose questions about their value and reliability as historical evidence. By exposing students to the critical examination of \u201cthe uses of the past,\u201d the course aims to teach them to appreciate the authoritative nature of historical interpretation and its practical application in contemporary social and political rhetoric. The study of pre-modern cultural and political history through the prism of nationalism theories explains many aspects of modern Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian societies, as well as political aspirations of their leaders. At the end of the course, students should develop understanding of the continuity and change in the history of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, their belief systems, and nationalistic ideologies, and will be able to speak and write about these issues with competence and confidence.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"EALC-8600","title":"Chinese Pedagogy","description":"This graduate course is designed to equip students with the most advanced and up-to-date theoretical knowledge and practical skills of teaching modern Chinese with emphasis on the instruction of beginning and intermediate levels.

Why do we sometimes get our way, while other times we walk away feeling frustrated by our inability to achieve the agreement we desire? Over the past few decades, research in social psychology and decision science has sought the answer to this question and created a rich body of knowledge on bargaining behavior, leading to a well-validated prescription on how to negotiate.

It traces the historical trajectory, from antiquity to the present day, of the idea that there once was, and again could be, a universal and perfect language among humanity. The tantalizing question of the possibility of such a language has been a vital and thought-provoking inquiry throughout human history. If recovered or invented, such a language has the potential to explain the origins, physical reality, and meaning of human experience, fostering universal understanding and world peace. Greek philosophers grappled with the capacity of names to correctly denote things. In Judaic and Christian traditions, the notion that the language spoken by Adam and Eve perfectly expressed the nature of the physical and metaphysical world captivated the minds of intellectuals for nearly two millennia. In defiance of the biblical myth of the confusion of languages and peoples at the Tower of Babel, they persistently endeavored to overcome divine punishment and rediscover the path to harmonious life. In the 19th century, Indo-Europeanist philologists perceived an avenue to explore the early stages of human development by reconstructing a proto-language. In the 20th century, romantic idealists like the inventor of Esperanto, Ludwik Zamenhof, constructed languages to further understanding among estranged nations. For writers and poets of all times, from Cyrano de Bergerac to Velimir Khlebnikov, the concept of a universal and perfect language has served as an inexhaustible source of inspiration. Today, this idea reverberates in theories of universal and generative grammars, in the approach to English as a global language, and in various attempts to devise artificial languages, including those intended for cosmic communication.\n\tEach week, we examine a particular period and a set of theories to explore universal language projects. But above all, at the core of the course lies an examination of what language is and how it is used in human society.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"ENVS-6611","title":"Floodplain Management","description":"According to a 2019 paper by Scott A.

By 2100, land now home to 200 million people could sit permanently below the high tide line as a result of rising sea levels from heat-trapping pollution from human activities. Add to these coastal challenges the inherent flood risks in riverine and urban settings. How do we prepare and adapt? The class will explore the challenge of floodplain management in a changing climate through lectures, discussions, talks by guest experts, readings and multimedia. Our class will look at the United States National Flood Insurance Program, examine its goals, critique its 50-year plus history and debate reforms to the program at the same time the U.S. Congress is considering long overdo reauthorization of the program. We will look at resiliency efforts that states and local governments are pursuing and the new and evolving city- and state-level position of Chief Resiliency Officer. In class we will cover hazard mitigation planning, land use, hard and natural infrastructure, regulations, the Community Rating System and other issues pertaining to flooding and climate change, including social justice and public health issues. The class will have a field trip to the New Jersey coast to explore high tide flooding and adaptation measures being taken.

Through study of these global circulations,students develop analytical skills that support further work in global studies. We look at the early historical creation of a \"Sinosphere\" in East Asia, as demand for ideas from China, from Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, led to the expansion of Chinese language and script and the invention of phonetic scripts. This innovation in scripts and interest in Chinese learning, and then Buddhism coming through China, contributed to the development of an East Asian thought world that is still defined by distinctive cultural traditions. The Indian Ocean trade, from the 7th to the 16th century, connected different cultural worlds by trade routes that themselves contributed to the spread of Islam. These trade networks built complex alliances and new societies with use of military power. The third circulation, the Atlantic trade from the 16th to the 19th century, connected Europe to West Africa, building an expanded trade in enslaved Africans and disrupted and transformed that region. Scholars analyzing the end of the slave trade have made competing arguments about changing economic conditions, the emergence of new economic interests, and efforts based on ethical commitments.

Bodies have long been the mainstay of art, but the attribution of sex to those bodies is a highly variable social phenomenon that tells us as much about the culture in question as it does about ourselves. Sex is thus in the eye of the beholder, defined by cultural, religious, scientific, and political norms, themselves often defined in and through a politics of visibility and exhibition.

From Renaissance battles over fig leaves to Enlightenment Europe\u2019s titillation at what they saw as the unbridled eroticism of the ancient world to the culture wars of today, sex has long been a hidden motor of shifts in the art world.

However, environmental policies and policy-making comprise more than just specific laws and regulations. Making and implementing environmental policy is a process influenced by multiple political, cultural, and economic factors in addition to scientific factors, all of which impact the ability of policies to be effective, that is, to actually improve the environment. In this course, we develop a framework to analyze the effectiveness of the social actors, process and outcomes of environmental policy-making. We ask questions such as: How do policy makers define environmental problems and solutions? Who are the social actors involved in the process? How are policies created and negotiated? What underlying assumptions and realities about the roles of government and society shape policy instruments and design? Are science and risk accurate or distorted? How are social and environmental justice intertwined?  To answer these complex questions, we contextualize and critically analyze policies to determine how both government and society impact on regulatory approaches. We study the institutions involved and examine social and ecological outcomes of environmental policies. We also discuss contemporary issues and policy situations that arise throughout the course of the semester, and comment on them in a class blog. Finally, students will select an environmental issue and formulate a policy proposal to recommend to decisionmakers.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":3.85,"instructor_quality":3.905,"difficulty":2.0,"work_required":2.0,"credits":1.0},{"id":"HIST-0120","title":"19th Cen Speakers and Speeches","description":"Rightly or wrongly, historians identify early nineteenth-century America as the \u2018Golden Age\u2019 of American oratory.

While ethnography is often narrowly conceived of as a methodology, this course considers ethnography as a mode of inquiry, as a philosophy, as an ongoing question and performance. We wrestle with notions of \"the self\" and \"the other\" at the intersection of imbricated cultural and performance worlds. Together we'll ask: How is ethnography both critical and performative? What is the relationship between theory and method? How can we evaluate ethnographic work? And finally, what kinds of ethnographers do we want to be?

We will focus on how scientists have understood anxiety; its place relative to other psychiatric symptoms and disorders, such as depression; and what social factors have increased its prevalence.  Along the way we will discuss the evolutionary dimensions of anxiety, as well as public beliefs about anxiety and its cultural significance.\nThis section of the course will explore growing climate anxiety and how people are responding to it in different ways. Raging forest fires, floods, drought, and erratic climate patterns seem to be ravaging our world with some scientists claiming that 1.5C global warming threshold has already been crossed. Set amidst a global climate emergency, the course aims to introduce students to key questions facing local and global climate futures, including resource and labour futures, the liveability of cities and countrysides, the future of food, energy, and the threat of species extinction.\n\nTaking stock of popular media, including documentaries, podcasts, and news reports, we will reflect on how people are dealing with the global environmental crisis. These responses range from collective social action, such as movements led by students, peasants, workers, and communities, and individual choices, including adopting eco-friendly lifestyles and choosing not to have children. It will also take stock of climate denialist positions from a sociological standpoint, which engages with the institutional and individual rationale for fearing how adopting a fossil fuel phase out and low energy consumption may impact lifestyles. The course hopes to introduce students to a sociology of the environmental crisis, and provide a strong foundation for interrogating alarmist, denialist and optimistic positions on climate futures.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":3.22,"instructor_quality":3.67,"difficulty":2.0,"work_required":1.0,"credits":1.0},{"id":"CRWR-2600","title":"Fiction Workshop","description":"Fiction Workshop is a course for students who are new to fiction writing or who are new to fiction writing or who would like to return to the fundamentals of fiction.

Specifically, we will consider the question whether it is possible for machines to become self-aware by asking what Natural Intelligence is, and considering what it implies about whether and how AGI can be achieved. To grapple with this question, in Part I of the course we will examine what is known about the emergence of Natural Intelligence in the universe. This study includes the phenomena of: (1a) Abiogenesis, (1b) The Universal Role of Entropy and Information in Evolution, (1c) Signal Transduction, intracellular signaling, and Mechanism of Stimulus-Response Coupling in Unicellular Organisms; (2a) The Evolution of the Metazoa during the Cambrian Explosion, (2b) The Consequences of Motility and Preditor - Prey Dynamics in the Metazoa for the Evolution of Complex Nervous Systems and Behaviors; (3a) The Implications of Invertebrate Navigation by Dead Reckoning for Understanding Insect Behavior, (3b) Insect Behavior in Relation to Robotics; (4a) Origin of the Vertebrates and the Evolution of the Vertebrate Nervous System, (4b) The Mammalian Neocortex; (5) Molecular Mechanisms of Synaptic  Plasticity; (6) The Evolution of the Hominins and the Hominin Brain; (7) Higher-Order Thinking and Epistemology; (8a) Meta-awareness as the Foundation of Human Consciousness, (8b) The Fluidity of Mind Embodiment, (8c) Theories and Philosophy of Human Consciousness. (9a) Other Minds: The Atypical Nervous System of the Ctenophore and The Nervous System and Mind of the Octopus, (9b) Animal intelligence. (10a) The History and Trajectory of AI, (10b) Superintelligence, Human Cognitive Fluidity and the Existence of a Global Network of Human Superintelligence.\nThis seminar course examines the emergence of life and mind in the universe to understand Natural Intelligence as the essential antecedent of Artificial Intelligence.  The goal is to provide a neuroscience perspective of AI and specifically to critically examine the question concerning whether machines can ever become self-aware.  This seminar course addresses the big questions related to the emergence of life, and mind in the context of physical law.   This includes consideration of the physical predicates of life and mind with emphasis on the central role of entropy and information in abiogenesis, the formation of life from non-living matter.   Mechanisms of signal transduction, intracellular signaling, and stimulus-response coupling in unicellular organisms will show how these processes provide a highly conserved basis for the cognitive behavioral innovations of multicellular organisms.  The origin of the vertebrates and the evolution of the vertebrate nervous system leading to the mammalian neocortex will be discussed in detail as the prelude to the evolution of the Hominins and the Hominin brain.  Cortical innovations that led to higher-order thinking, and meta-awareness as the foundation of modern human consciousness will then be explored.    Theories of human consciousness and the creativity that derives from the power of abstract thinking will be examined as the foundation of human collective intelligence that has led to the existence of a global network of human superintelligence.  With this background, the history and nature of AI with special attention to neural networks will be considered in detail as we reflect on the irony that we neither know how the brain makes the mind nor how neural networks accomplish their impressive achievements.

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\nHow does literature contend with the legacies of empire, specifically, modern European colonial rule in the 20th century? How have authors interpreted and responded to decolonisation, and relatedly, to emergent forms of neo-colonialism? How have these processes shaped contestations around issues of gender, race, class, caste and nation? This course will think through these concerns that continue to shape art, culture and society in the Global South today, long after the end of formal empire. We will analyze contemporary novels, short stories and essays addressing regions and contexts ranging from South Asia and West Africa to the Caribbean and post-war Britain.

But global progress in improving human well-being has been neither linear nor universal. For instance, measured at living on just $5.50 a day per person, nearly 3.5 billion people still live in extreme poverty. Moreover, humankind now faces several unprecedented existential threats to human life itself such as global warming and the persistence or spread of drug-resistant infectious diseases including ones once thought to be nearly eradicated. In this course, students are introduced to multiple and competing concepts and empirical theories on each of two interrelated questions regarding global leadership and problem-solving: (1) What, if any, particular approaches (for example, \"collaborative governance\" or \"boundary-spanning leadership\") might predictably and reliably increase the odds that the next century-long chapter in the annals of global human well-being--the chapter to be written between now and the decade that will begin in 2120--will be a tale of greater wealth, health, and happiness for all or most people worldwide? (2) Under what, if any, conditions can diverse institutions--families and social networks; neighborhood and community groups; nonprofit or social sector organizations; for-profit firms; and local, national, and transnational government institutions--act, either independently or in tandem with each other, to maintain or improve human well-being? Each student quasi-independently researches and writes a capstone research paper describing, analyzing, and assessing an existing policy or program pertaining to one of the following three challenges: elder care with a focus on China; education with a focus on Africa; or economic development with a focus on Latin America.\nThe prerequisites for this course are LEAD 1010, LEAD 1040\/3040, LEAD 2020, LEAD 2030, LEAD 3100, LEAD 3200, and LEAD 3300, plus one of the following: DATA 1010, MTHS 1000, MTHS 2000, or MTHS 2200.\nCourse offered by Penn LPS Online.

As such, we will incorporate insight from evolutionary theory, ecology, developmental biology, psychology, human biology, and cultural anthropology in our study of growth and development. Such an integrated perspective will help students to see that development is not just a biological unfolding from birth through adolescence and adulthood. Rather, development is best understood as process that is deeply intertwined with the environment within which the organism develops. Additionally, we will apply these biocultural and socio-ecological insights to emerging health challenges associated with various developmental stages.

Drawing on insights from psychology, sociology, and anthropology, we will explore the cultural and personal dimensions of work, as well as the contemporary challenges and opportunities of the future of work. Topics will include the culture of work, psychological identity and career development, organizational science, work-life wellness, and the future of work. Concurrently, students will be asked to apply their understanding of these concepts to their personal conceptions of career across their lifespan. Our class will also provide ample opportunity, space, and guidance for students to effectively synthesize an iteration of their professional identity based on a variety of factors internal and external to their existence. More specifically, students will work to probe the meaning of their professional narrative, and then, translate how those choices will guide their future endeavors.\nWe will begin by studying the qualitative method of autoethnography. Using this foundation, we will then examine a sociological lens of work, specifically discovering how individual and cultural values, norms, and assumptions intersect with our collective and cultural understandings of careers.\nFollowing this, we will turn to psychology to foster the connection between our interests and goals, and probe how these traits and states guide career pursuits. Additionally, we will discuss the broader concept of identity in its many forms and fashions. Then, we will discuss how career choices contribute to identity development by reading scholars such as Savickas. We also will look to the organizational science literature to learn more about well-being as it relates to work. Concluding this component of the course, we will consider lifelong career development as a continuous process of design and redesign based on internal and external stimuli, and summarize research on well-being and work.\nFinally, we will delve into Krumboltz\u2019s theory of career happenstance, which encourages professionals to consider how chance can modify and enhance career trajectory.  We also will talk about the future of work, and how learning, un-learning, and re-learning will contribute to career agility.\nThrough satisfactory completion of this course, degree students will be able to:\nDemonstrate increased knowledge of the broader cultural or conceptual contexts of work, specifically focusing on values, assumptions, and norms\nPractice design thinking when considering career decision-making, harnessing the power of iterative processes\nEvaluate the theoretical and practical implications of the relationship between work and life, incorporating appropriate concepts and techniques to integrate personal and professional behaviors for long-term well-being\nAnalyze the intersectionality of personal and professional identity\nEmploy critical thinking to analyze how self-reflection can guide career\nFormulate future professional plans through the lens of predictions on the future of work, generating increasingly nuanced interpretations of career development and explaining why those plans are congruent to their identity.\nEach week, assignments will scaffold to support students in the composition of an autoethnography, the final deliverable of this course.\nBAAS Students must have senior status in order to enroll in BAAS 4000.

Many folks residing in the U.S. regard it as perfectly normal for clinicians to examine patients with instruments, for specialists to expose people\u2019s bodies to many different machines, and for those machines to produce data that is mechanically\/electronically processed, interpreted and stored. People are billed technologically, prompted to attend appointments technologically, and buy everyday consumer technologies to protect, diagnose, or improve our health. (Consider, for example, air-purifiers, heart rate monitors, pregnancy testing kits, blood-sugar monitoring tests, and thermometers.) Yet even at the beginning of the twentieth century, devices such as these were scarce and infrequently used by American physicians and medical consumers alike. Over the course of this semester, we examine how \u201ctechnology\u201d came to medicine\u2019s center-stage in the U.S., and what impact this change has had on medical practice, institutions, and consumers alike.\nTechnology & Medicine in Modern America fulfills the Capstone research requirement for the HSOC major.

Student topics can be wildly diverse and reflect their own interests and concentration: reproductive technologies, technology & disability, pharma & biotech, public health tech, medicalized consumers\/\u201deveryday\u201d med tech, technology & enhancement, med tech & the military, and so on. By the end of the course, students will have honed their skills in primary and secondary source research and in constructing an academic argument and paper.\nAssignments. Students formulate a research question; appropriately situate their question within the literature of a core STSC\/HSOC discipline (anthropology, sociology, or history); and build an argument (an answer to their research question) based on their analysis of primary sources. In addition, students continue to develop skills in critical analysis through weekly reading assignments and discussions. Requirements therefore include: weekly readings and participation in class discussions; sequenced research assignments; first draft peer review workshop; and a final 20+page original research paper and presentation.\nCourse Format. The course fosters a collaborative atmosphere in which students complete an original research paper through critical reading and step-wise assignments that culminate in a final project. Tuesdays & Thursdays 1:45-3:15pm EST = class discussion, about shared texts or about research or writing. Class time will occasionally be reserved for asynchronous time to work on research assignments. All readings and reading notes are due at 1:45pm in advance of our class sessions.

The goal of this course is to expand on students' general understanding of the immune system and to focus this understanding towards the application of modern vaccines and immune therapies in the 21st century. The course will provide the student with a sense of how these principles are applied to a vaccine and immune therapeutic development. The course covers basic vaccine science and describes how this science is translated through clinical, regulatory, ethical, and political issues to result in a final vaccine product. The courses' goal is to leave the student with an understanding of the implications of modern vaccines \/immunotherapies and their impact on world health. Initial lectures review immune mechanisms believed to be responsible for vaccine-induced protection from disease. Subsequent lectures build on this background to explore the science of vaccines for diverse pathogens, including agents of bioterrorism, as well as vaccines and immunotherapies for cancer. An appreciation for the application of laboratory science to the clinical development and clinical trials of vaccines are provided. An important focus on the regulatory, safety, and ethical implications of vaccines in different world situations based on true world examples are presented. The financial implications of specific vaccines with these implications for global health is a focus of the course. The course is presented in a lecture-style consisting of multiple distinguished guest lecturers who are experts in their particular area of vaccine development. There are required readings to provide the student context and background for the diverse lectures. Students are graded on course participation and a final project\/exam which the students will present. The project is to design a vaccine strategy for a current disease or pathogen of importance that does not as yet have an effective vaccine or immune therapy and present this to the class. Strategies used should build on the material presented in the class lectures. The course is intended for graduate students or medical students in various MS, Ph.D., or MD\/Ph.D. programs on the campus, as well as local scientists and professionals in the community.

Is it possible to envisage history as in part determined by struggles occurring at the level of the visual?\u201d Christopher Pinney, Photos of the Gods: The Printed Image and Political Struggle in India. \nThis seminar takes partial charge from the question with which the anthropologist Christopher Pinney starts his study of chromolithography and colonial resistance in India, bringing it to bear more broadly on the ways in which we approach the photographic image, especially as it was first conceptualized and continues to be practiced in regions beyond Europe. Whereas it is now largely agreed that photography was not \u201cinvented\u201d in one particular place or moment, but rather \u201cannounced\u201d as a suite of nearly simultaneous discoveries, studies of the photographic and, in particular, its place in contemporary culture, still largely depend on a handful of ideas about representation, vision, and visuality that derive from western epistemologies and the logics built into the languages in which they were articulated. So, against a history of photography that has treated the medium as variously defined ontologically by its mechanical nature, its indexical nature, or its capacity to represent or replace the real, we will try to understand how the functioning capacity of the image, its use, and reception exceed these western models such that photographs come to take on the life of material objects; become opportunities for imagination and not documentation; become animate as well as theatrical; and, provide us with sites through which we might re-vision the certainty with which we approach time and space as the coordinates of the real and hence the strata (and data) of history. Further moving away from the idea that the photograph documents and preserves in the present events or people that are now past, we look to an even more complicated temporality that approaches the various ways in which photography is embedded in a future oriented thinking that allows us to see what is not physically (yet) there, or not (yet) visible\u2014the apparently invisible or unimaginable, in fact: things and possibilities we have considered foregone. To do so, we will consider photography as situated in other epistemologies and faith-based understandings of life, death, and the real.

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\nThis course makes the book itself an object of interpretation and a means for understanding literature of the Romantic Period. Rather than surveying a few poems by many writers, we will read 10 writers in depth. Most important, we will read them in the exact, published forms in which they were read and reviewed by their peers. How did authors and publishers compile, organize, and market books to a reading public? How is it different reading a poem, essay, or short story in the context of a larger collection instead of on its own? To answer these questions, we will thoroughly acquaint ourselves with the careers of each writer we read, with how their books were produced and reviewed, and with the contexts into which each book ventured into the world. This course will be a true seminar, in which we come to a table to discuss common interests and, through our discussions, come to more informed opinions -- and further interests. For that reason, do tell me if you have particular authors and interests in the Romantic Period (roughly 1770-1848) you wish to pursue. I plan to choose our course texts from the books below, and invite interested students to tell me their reading preferences: Henry Mackenzie, The Man of Feeling (1771); Anna Letitia Barbauld, Poems (1773); Charlotte Smith, Elegiac Sonnets (1784); Helen Maria Williams Poems (1786); Robert Burns, Poems Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (1786); Olaudah Equiano, The Interesting Narrative (1789); The British Album (1790); William Blake, Songs of Innocence and Experience (1789, 1794); an issue of The Anti-Jacobin, or Weekly Examiner (1797); Joanna Baillie, Plays on the Passions (1798); William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lyrical Ballads, with a few other Poems (1800); Mary Robinson, Lyrical Tales (1800); William Blake, Milton (1804); William Wordsworth, Poems, in Two Volumes (1807); Lord Byron, The Giaour (1813); Walter Scott, Waverley (1814); Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Christabel, Kubla Khan, and the Pains of Sleep (1816); Mary Shelley, Frankenstein (1818); Percy Bysshe Shelley, Prometheus Unbound and other Poems (1820); John Keats, Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes, and other Poems (1820); an issue of Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine; Percy Shelley, Posthumous Poems (1824); Felicia Hemans, Records of Woman (1828); The Keepsake (1829); an issue of The Lady's Magazine (1830).\n","prerequisites":"","course_quality":2.879,"instructor_quality":3.095,"difficulty":2.693,"work_required":2.773,"credits":1.0},{"id":"NSCI-3100","title":"Evolution of Warfare","description":"This course is designed to add broad historical perspective to understanding military power.

These strategies will include the use of environmental enrichment, the application of positive reinforcement training, effective exhibit design, and leveraging available research on captive wild species.\nWhile the principles of animal welfare remain consistent across difference captive animal settings (e.g., labs, farms, zoos, and shelters), it is especially important to understand the specific needs of individual species in zoos and aquariums as a way to meet their behavioural needs. This requires effective networking approaches within the scientific and animal care communities to gather knowledge and build effective collaborations, and this course will touch on best practices for building and maintaining effective professional networks.\nIn their final project, students will use their understanding of welfare and principles of environmental enrichment to design an enrichment initiative for a chosen zoo\/aquarium species that will have the potential to significantly improve their welfare if implemented in a captive environment.

Is early Rus a mother state of Russia or of Ukraine, and, therefore, should it be spelled \u2018Kyivan Rus,\u2019 or \u2018Kievan Rus\u2019 in English? Has the culture of Russian political despotism been inherited from the Mongols, or is it an autochthonous ideology?

Students gain knowledge about formative events and prominent figures, as well as social and cultural developments during this period.\nThe course takes multidisciplinary approach by combining the study of textual sources, objects of art and architecture, music, ritual, and film in their social and historical contexts. Students learn to analyze and interpret primary sources (historical documents and literary texts), identify their intellectual issues, and understand the historical, cultural, and social contexts in which these sources emerged.

Globalizing economic paradigms encourage one model that, while it connects distant regions with the ease of a finger-tap, also homogenizes the world, manufacturing patterns of sameness behind simulations of diversity.

Through the idea of World Literature, this course introduces students to the appreciation and critical analysis of literary texts, with the aim of navigating calls for universality or particularity (and perhaps both) in fiction and film. \"World literature\" here refers not merely to the usual definition of \"books written in places other than the US and Europe, \"but any form of cultural production that explores and pushes at the limits of a particular world, that steps between and beyond worlds, or that heralds the coming of new worlds still within us, waiting to be born.

The history of Christianity - from its nebulous beginnings in Palestine to its recognition as the official religion of the Roman Empire and subsequent expansion - is often narrated from a perspective that privileges the writings of elite men. To capture the rich diversity in Christian experience and expression, we will turn to the material practices of religion and explore how things, places, and bodily acts shaped what it meant to be Christian. Building on insights drawn from archaeology, art history, anthropology, and religious studies, we will seek to recover the experiences of diverse and often marginalized subjects and communities, and in the process, will problematize the categories of religion, authority, and identity. Regular visits to the Penn Museum and other collections in Philadelphia will complement lectures and group discussions.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":3.63,"instructor_quality":3.755,"difficulty":3.43,"work_required":3.57,"credits":1.0},{"id":"CBE-9990","title":"Thesis\/Diss Research","description":"For students working on an advanced research program leading to the completion of master's thesis or Ph.D. dissertation requirements.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"IMUN-6990","title":"Laboratory Rotation","description":"Lab rotation.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":0.0},{"id":"CIS-4360","title":"Intro Comp Bio&Bio Model","description":"The goal of this course is to develop a deeper understanding of techniques and concepts used in Computational Biology.

The voyages of exploration undertaken by Europeans in the 15th and 16th century created, in just a few decades, a global economy. By 1600, silver from Mexico was exchanged in Manila for ceramics made in Nanjing (China). After a long trip through the Pacific, Mexico, and the Atlantic, the ceramics ended up in the tables of prosperous merchants in Bruges (modern day Belgium). How did this integrated global economy appear? How did global interconnections over the centuries shap our current world? How did markets emerge and influence these interconnections? Who were the winners of globalization? And who were the losers? How did economists, political scientists, and others think about the strengths and weakness of market economies?  This course will explore these questions and the role that markets have played in it from the late 15th century to the present. Even if the economic theory will structure much of the discussion, insights from intellectual history, cultural history, microhistory, legal history, and institutional history will help to frame the main narrative. The course will be, as well, truly global. First, beyond the traditional focus of economic history courses on Europe and the Americas, particular attention will be devoted to Africa and Asia. Second, the priority will be to highlight the interconnections between the different regions and to understand how the people living in them negotiated the opportunities and tensions created by the economic transformations triggered by globalization and how they conceptualized the changing lives around them. Finally, the class will highlight how diverse intellectual traditions handled the challenges presented by historical change.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":2.979,"instructor_quality":3.293,"difficulty":2.347,"work_required":2.337,"credits":1.0},{"id":"MUSC-6230","title":"Composing For Performers","description":"This graduate level composition seminar brings active focus to composing for live performers.

Using the upcoming Hilma Af Klint exhibition at the Guggenheim as a focus and departure point, this course will explore the ways in which artists have accessed alternative ways of seeing, knowing, and embodying non-visible realities as a source for their work. Accessing spiritual realms has been the subject of early European Modernisms investigations into Theosophy and Anthroposophy, as well as the primary intention of Tibetan Thangkas and Indian Tantra paintings. Postmodernism's crisis of belief and skepticism generated a cultural situation wherein the subject of spirituality was marginalized, ridiculed as anti- intellectual, and in disgrace. The Hilma Af Klint exhibition and surge of interest in her work signifies a new moment, where questions about consciousness and the nature of reality are being addressed with renewed vigor. How do we create space in a technology driven world for experiences that attempt to align the viewer\/maker with the contemplative realm, heightened states of consciousness, or transcendence?

Often, organizations will seek to go further, analyzing their own data to identify problems and learn what is working and what is not in their own context. This course applies the insights of the people analytics movement to help students become better managers and more critical analysts within their organizations. The course aims to develop students in three specific ways. First, it provides students with an up-to-the-minute grounding in current evidence about managing people, providing a knowledge base that can ensure that their future management is guided by best practices. Second, it develops the skills and understanding necessary to be thoughtful, critical consumers of evidence on people management, allowing them to make the most of the analysis available to them as they make people decisions. Third, it provides guidance and practice in conducting people analytics, preparing students to gather data of their own, and making them more skilled analysts.

The course is intended for students with a basic knowledge of regression, and will be especially useful for students with practical experience in a policy setting who want to learn about advanced research methods. The course begins by exploring policy analysis frameworks, and the contexts of social policy and social policy research.  The remainder of the course explores a variety of common approaches to the conduct of social policy research by looking at the types of questions social policy analysts most frequently ask, and the types of answers that they are most often able to provide.  The policy analysis approaches we will examine include: needs assessment methodologies (e.g. the \u201cepidemiology\u201d of social problems); analyses of client-level service utilization patterns (e.g. creating \u201ctypologies\u201d); modeling trends in demand for services over time (e.g. forecasting); locational and other spatial factors associated with need, service use, and resource allocation decisions (e.g. block grant formula funding); machine learning (e.g. predictive analytics); the roles of qualitative research methods in policy research; comparative research on social welfare policy; performance management applications of administrative data; and longitudinal, multisectoral research using integrated administrative data systems.  The application of these various methods is illustrated with studies of mental health, homelessness, criminal justice, child welfare, housing and segregation, welfare reform, income inequality and social service planning.

But only 10 million do. Drugs containing tenofovir--the standard of care in developed countries are expensive. Stavudine-based treatments are much cheaper but have worse side-effects. Is it ethical to use stavudine-based rather than tenofovir-based treatments in sub-Saharan Africa? Smoking rates have decreased drastically in most developed countries. But they are increasing in many developing countries. Established public health measures are not implemented, and the tobacco industry pursues a range of marketing activities that would be unacceptable in developed countries. As a consequence, global deaths from smoking are expected to increase to 1bn by the end of the 21st century, with 80% of deaths in developing countries. Is industry s behavior immoral or normal in a global market? ARDS is a disease of premature newborns. Is it ethical to test a new ARDS drug in Bolivia if the drug--if proven to be effective-- will be very expensive and accessible only to the richest people in Bolivia and other developing countries? An overarching question that these different cases raise is whether there are universal ethical standards that should apply to all people, or whether regional variations should be acceptable. Universalists typically argue that there must be no double standards, and that people should be treated the same regardless of where they live. Pragmatists raise concerns about moral imperialism, neo-colonialism, or insufficient respect for cultural or other differences. Increasing globalization fuels debates about which of competing sets of moral standards is the right one. Looking at a range of diverse cases including healthcare research, health policy, flu pandemics, family planning, smoking and obesity policy, and genetically modified crops, this course explores controversies in the cross winds of market forces, politics and ethics, and examines the roles and responsibilities of key actors and international policy guidance.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"LAWM-5760","title":"ML: Intro To Patent Law","description":"Online Course - Knowledge of patent law can be a tremendous advantage for engineers, doctors, entrepreneurs, and other professionals who regularly interact with the patent system.

In addition, the course will cover critical assessments of fielded models and studies using them. The course will focus broadly on models pertaining to energy and sustainability. This is not only an inherently interesting and important area, but it is very much a public one. In consequence, models, data, and studies using them are publicly and profusely available, as is excellent journalism, which facilitates introductions to specific topics. The course covers selected topics in energy and sustainability. Essential background will be presented as needed, but the course is not a comprehensive overview of energy and sustainability. Modeling in the area of energy and sustainability analytics is rife with uncertainty, and yet decisions must be made. Uncertainty, and how to deal with it in model-based decision making, is an overarching theme of the course. We will focus on energy and sustainability, but that area is hardly unique in being beset with deep and vexing uncertainties. The lessons we learn will generalize.

CAR T cells, gene therapy for sickle cell disease, radionuclides etc.) have revolutionized modern clinical medicine.  Historically, these agents were first developed in academia then transferred to industry for clinical scale manufacturing.  Recently, however, some academic centers have developed clinical scale biomanufacturing facilities. Operation of these new facilities requires a unique blend of manufacturing, clinical, basic, regulatory and laboratory sciences. Examples of areas in which academic medical centers have developed in-house manufacturing include cell therapy, gene therapy and novel imaging agents.  This course will cover manufacturing approaches, challenges, and controversies in each of these domains.\nAt the completion of this course students will understand:\n-The general approach to development, manufacturing, quality control and regulatory compliance in academic manufacturing facilities\n-Critical steps in the manufacturing cycles of cell therapies, gene therapies and imaging agents\n-Current challenges in development, manufacturing, and maintaining regulatory compliance in academic manufacturing\n-Key considerations and relative merits of different positions in the current controversies surround these agents\nEach week includes a combination of synchronous and asynchronous work.  Synchronous sessions will include instructor led discussions based on pre-recorded lectures or case-based discussions.  Asynchronous material includes pre-recorded lectures and discussion board prompts to which students will respond throughout the week.\nOne unique aspect to this course are the debates.  For each debate week, two students will be assigned as debaters and will represent opposing points of view.  All students will be provided with required pre-reading and pre-recorded lectures relevant to the debate topic.  Ahead of the debate, the debaters will meet with an assigned faculty advisor to help to prepare.  Students who are not assigned as debaters for that week will post questions to the discussion board ahead of the debate.  The debate will occur during a synchronous session.  The debaters will deliver a short introductory statement.  This will be followed by QA with the audience.  Finally, the debates will deliver a closing statement.  These debates are a fun and interactive way for students to engage with controversial and evolving topics in the field. By the end of the course, students will appreciate the academic perspective on core elements of therapeutic and diagnostic agent manufacturing.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"WRIT-0370","title":"Writing Seminar In Econ","description":"This writing seminar focuses on a scholarly inquiry in the field of Economics, the study of the consumption of commodities and the distribution, production, and transfer of wealth.

Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole. We will understand how the size of the US economy is determined, how unemployment is measured, how inflation affects life. We will look at policy options that the government and the Federal Reserve Bank face, and discuss pros and cons of their actions. Economic arguments are often used in debates about government policies, discussion of business strategies, and many of life's other arenas.

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\nHow does literature contend with the legacies of empire, specifically, modern European colonial rule in the 20th century? How have authors interpreted and responded to decolonisation, and relatedly, to emergent forms of neo-colonialism? How have these processes shaped contestations around issues of gender, race, class, caste and nation? This course will think through these concerns that continue to shape art, culture and society in the Global South today, long after the end of formal empire. We will analyze contemporary novels, short stories and essays addressing regions and contexts ranging from South Asia and West Africa to the Caribbean and post-war Britain. Texts will serve to introduce students to key authors and theoretical debates within the field of postcolonial literatures, and may include Chinua Achebe\u2019s Thing Fall Apart, Arundhati Roy\u2019s The God of Small Things and Frantz Fanon\u2019s The Wretched of the Earth.

Religion is never divorced from its place and its time. Furthermore, by geographically and historically grounding the study of these religions we will be able to examine how their individual ethic, cosmological and soteriological systems effect local history, economics, politics, and material culture. We will concentrate first on the person of the Buddha, his many biographies and how he has been followed and worshipped in a variety of ways from Lhasa, Tibet to Phrae, Thailand. From there we touch on the foundational teachings of the Buddha with an eye to how they have evolved and transformed over time. Finally, we focus on the practice of Buddhist ritual, magic and ethics in monasteries and among aly communities in Asia and even in the West. This section will confront the way Buddhists have thought of issues such as \"Just-War,\" Women's Rights and Abortion.

Additionally, the prevalence of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy practices and increased access to these medicines overall make it important for the next generation of clinicians to be familiar with psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) practices. Even if clinical social workers are not planning to center PAT in their practice, it is highly likely that they will be working with people who may come to them needing to integrate expansive experiences or may want to discuss the use of PAT as a supplement to their therapeutic work.

We suggest that if you're new to the various social media platforms mentioned, that you jump in and try them out! These platforms are designed for individuals with all levels of technical proficiency, and they're designed to be inviting. You might find that with only a bit of effort that you become comfortable with them quickly. We expect that, regardless of your skill level, comfort, and current personal use of social media, you will gain real value from this course. Much of this value relates to conveying an understanding of how to use these tools strategically, and on behalf of a social venture or a social cause you care about. This sort of use of social media is significantly different than the way you would use it in your personal life. We hope, as you move through this course, you will wonder: 1) What does it mean to craft the voice of an institution? 2) What is it like to speak in the voice of an institution instead of my own? 3) How could one possibly develop a strategic plan to organically and authentically engage a community? 4) How do you define, find, and build community? 5) More than retweets and likes, what is engagement, how do you measure it, and how do you create engagement to spark social change?\nCourse meets on Monday 5:15pm to 6:45pm November 11th to December 16th","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":0.5},{"id":"ENGL-2604","title":"Books in America","description":"This course investigates book histories and the worlds of readers, printers, publishers, and libraries in the Americas, from the colonial period through the nineteenth century.

While no background in statistics or political science is required, students are expected to be generally familiar with contemporary computing environments (e.g. know how to use a computer) and have a willingness to learn a variety of data science tools. Leaving this class, students will be prepared to deepen their R skills in PSCI 3800, and then use their R skills to learn statistics in PSCI 1801 and 3801. They will also be ready to use their R skills in courses in other disciplines as well.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":2.887,"instructor_quality":3.064,"difficulty":2.727,"work_required":2.754,"credits":1.0},{"id":"MSSP-6680","title":"Econ For Social Policy","description":"Economics allows us to determine the costs and benefits of social policies like cash benefits, unemployment insurance, health insurance, pensions, education, etc. Policies typically affect the behavior of agents like individuals, families and firms, and we have to take these reactions into account when analyzing policy. Economics allows us to predict how policy is likely to affect behavior by understanding how the policy changes individuals' decisions, and what collective outcomes these myriad individual decisions bring about. For example, a universal basic income allows individuals to sustain themselves and their families when they are not working. At the same time, such guaranteed income has the potential to discourage people from looking for a job. If enough people are discouraged from looking for a job, employment in the economy will decrease, leading to lower production and lower tax revenues for the government. Policy makers have to take these phenomena into account in order to design a good income support system.\nEnrollment is limited to students with a major in Social Policy and 2nd year students with a major in Social Policy & Data Analytics.

Contrary to the popular perception that the Middle East defines Islam, Asian countries not only host the most Muslims in the world but have been the source of some of Islam's most important social and reform movements in the last three hundred years. This class looks at the history of Muslim societies across Asia not just as a religious community but also as a social and cultural bloc (a distinctive part of what Marshall Hodgson called the 'Islamicate' world, but also an area that challenges some of Hodgson's assumptions about the Islamicate world). This course allows for the study of the Muslim world between the years1700 to present. The class will allow students to compare and contrast Muslim societies over the last three centuries, examine points of confluence for geographically- or culturally- distinct Muslim peoples in the last three centuries, and in their writing assignments focus on the history of one society in a wider Islamicate context.

The underpinnings of the field continued to grow in the works of enslaved Africans, abolitionists and social critics of the nineteenth century, and evolved in the twentieth century by black writers, journalists, activists, and educators as the sought to document African descended people's lives.

These changes are evident across numerous areas of design, from wearable technologies that track and analyze, to large scale building initiatives that aim to create healthier environments and improve lives through strategic planning initiatives. A concrete, physical representation of this paradigm shift can be found within the hospital building itself and in the new manner in which hospitals are looking to serve their patients and care for their clinicians. Simultaneously both public and private spaces, hospitals are complex systems in which sickness, health, hospitality, technology, emergency, and community share space and compete for resource. In order to frame our present day understanding of the role of architecture (and design) in fostering health for individuals and within communities, this seminar will begin with an exploration of the historical and contemporary perspectives on the role of the architect and built environment on health. (Parallels between design and our ever-changing understanding of the biological, social, and environmental causes of sickness and disease will also be explored.) During this conversation,  students will read articles and study recently constructed projects in order to examine the ways in which the architects approached these topics through built form. Following from this foundation, students will craft arguments for a new approach to the individual, the community, health, and architecture through a written response and architecturally designed scenario that argues for their perspective on how architecture can and should shape the health of those who inhabit it. Throughout the course, students will engage in weekly readings (and discussions) of critical texts exploring ideas around the role and impact of architecture on health.

We're bombarded with media rhetoric daily, and often we're aware of it as a means of manipulating our thoughts and actions, yet we consume and often succumb. We're all products of our media's unrelenting rhetorical machinations. In this seminar we'll study the rhetoric of persuasion in modern media, its historical development, and the ways it draws us into its milieu. We'll investigate how these media unite us and divide us, and hopefully come to understand them well enough to resist being pawns of the rhetoric we encounter.

Beginning in the fifteenth century in Europe, these media connected new audiences across geographies by providing access to the same visual information. Prints launched propagandistic missions, fomented rebellion against authorities, and built networks of progressive thinkers who could envision alternative futures. Prints played a key role in developing what constituted news. Mass-distributed images delivered the mistreatment of the \u201cIndians\u201d by the Spanish and portrayed the packing of Africans on a slave ship. Goya\u2019s etchings protested the repression of the Second of May uprising. The silkscreens of Andy Warhol repeated the image of police dogs attacking civil rights activists in Birmingham. Covering a five-hundred-year history, this course will focus on how printed images created communities and acted as exclusionary devices. We will train our eyes on examples from local collections and pay particular attention to Philadelphia activist groups and their places in these histories.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"GSWS-0860","title":"Performance and Politics","description":"This class addresses the meeting points inside of and between a range of resistant performance practices with a focus on artists using performance to address political and social encounters in the contemporary moment. Performance, a chaotic and unruly category that slides across music, dance, theater and visual art, has long been a container for resistant actions\/activities that bring aesthetics and politics into dynamic dialogue. Embracing works, gestures, movements, sounds and embodiments that push against and beyond the conventions of a given genre, performance can't help but rub uncomfortably against the status quo. Scholars working across Performance Studies and Black Studies importantly expanded critical discourse around performance to address the entanglement of the medium with physical, psychic, spatial and temporal inhabitations of violence and power. Generating copious genealogies of embodied resistance, this scholarship instigates a complex, interdisciplinary and multidimensional perspective on intersections between art and life, performance and politics. The class hosts a series of public lectures, presentations and performances by visual artists, choreographers, theater artists, composers\/musicians, performers, curators and activists engaged with the social and political moment. Presentations will be open  to the public with students in the course developing in-depth research into the work of each visiting artist\/performer\/presenter to engage the larger context of each visitor's scholarship and\/or practice through readings, discussion and in-class presentations.

Such a physician might also be dismayed to learn that old enemies such as tuberculosis, malaria, diphtheria, West Nile virus, meningococcal meningitis, Yellow fever, and Dengue have become more (or rather less) prevalent due to antibiotic resistance and other factors.

The social worker\/practitioner will encounter a wide range of symptomatic presentations among his\/her clients.

After World War II in the U.S.A., a model of understanding symptoms from a systemic\/cybernetic point of view revolutionized the diagnostic processes involved in working with children and adolescents. Since the late 1980's, postmodern ideas, primarily from Europe and Australia, have greatly influenced and informed the understanding of psychopathology in children and adolescents.

No previous experience required, just curiosity and willingness to engage. In this intergenerational seminar, Penn students together with older community members read groundbreaking playwright August Wilson's American Century Cycle: ten plays that form an iconic picture of African American traditions, traumas, and triumphs through the decades, nearly all told through the lens of Pittsburgh's Hill District neighborhood. (Two of Wilson\u2019s plays are receiving fresh attention with recent acclaimed film versions: Fences with Denzel Washington and Viola Davis; Ma Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom with Davis and Chadwick Boseman.) Class participants develop relationships with one other while exploring the history and culture that shaped these powerful plays.\nAs an Academically Based Community Service (ABCS) course, the class plans and hosts events for a multigenerational, West Philadelphia-focused audience with community partners West Philadelphia Cultural Alliance \/ Paul Robeson House & Museum, and Theatre in the X. Class members come to a deeper understanding of Black life in Philadelphia through stories community members share in oral history interviews.

Performance, a chaotic and unruly category that slides across music, dance, theater and visual art, has long been a container for resistant actions\/activities that bring aesthetics and politics into dynamic dialogue. Embracing works, gestures, movements, sounds and embodiments that push against and beyond the conventions of a given genre, performance can't help but rub uncomfortably against the status quo. Scholars working across Performance Studies and Black Studies importantly expanded critical discourse around performance to address the entanglement of the medium with physical, psychic, spatial and temporal inhabitations of violence and power. Generating copious genealogies of embodied resistance, this scholarship instigates a complex, interdisciplinary and multidimensional perspective on intersections between art and life, performance and politics.

The course consists of three parts:  Part 1) Philanthropy and Healthcare in Society: The US has a long tradition of channeling philanthropic resources to augment healthcare in society, as the demand for health care exceeds the capacity of individuals or government to fully satisfy the demand. Philanthropic resources, which include both time and money, are emerging as significant means by which the capacity of the healthcare sector is fortified; these include resources for service providers, health care researchers, and health care policy advocates. To understand the heterogeneous impact of philanthropy on healthcare, this part of the course will examine the \"who, what, when, where, and how\" of philanthropic inputs into healthcare and their impact.  Part 2) Health Effects on the Individual Philanthropist: The second part of the course examines individuals who give of their time and money. From decreased mortality to better health outcomes, researchers have carefully documented the effect on individual givers. Recent findings from the health sciences also show what mechanisms might be involved in an individual's psychology and physiology that can explain the beneficial health effects of philanthropic behavior.

Both stereotype threat and impostor phenomenon negatively affect African Americans. The apprehension experienced by African Americans that they might behave in a manner that confirms an existing negative cultural stereotype is stereotype threat, which usually results in reduced effectiveness in African Americans' performance. Stereotype threat is linked with impostor phenomenon. Impostor phenomenon is an internal experience of intellectual phoniness in authentically talented individuals, in which they doubt their accomplishments and fear being exposed as a fraud. While stereotype threat relies on broad generalization, the impostor phenomenon describes feelings of personal inadequacy, especially in high-achieving African Americans.

What led a person to undertake an essential transformation of identity that could affect everything from food to family to spiritual fulfillment?

We will investigate the motivations for conversions, the obstacles faced by converts, and the issues raised by conversion from the perspective of those who remained within a single tradition. How did conversion efforts serve globalization and empire, and what other power relations were involved? How did peoplehood, nationality, or race play out in conversion and its aftermath? How did premodern people understand conversion differently from each other, and differently than their coreligionists or scholars do today?

Embracing works, gestures, movements, sounds and embodiments that push against and beyond the conventions of a given genre, performance can't help but rub uncomfortably against the status quo. Scholars working across Performance Studies and Black Studies importantly expanded critical discourse around performance to address the entanglement of the medium with physical, psychic, spatial and temporal inhabitations of violence and power. Generating copious genealogies of embodied resistance, this scholarship instigates a complex, interdisciplinary and multidimensional perspective on intersections between art and life, performance and politics.

Specifically, you will gain skills to determine how to gather adequate information, interpret information and put this information into clear and helpful frameworks for formulating recommendations for action. To learn these skills, you will work in small groups on a technical proposal throughout the semester. Throughout the semester, we will seek a more nuanced understanding of the general context and the role of institutions in global development work, while being aware of local realities and ethical issues that make development as contested locally as it is at national and global levels. Development from this perspective is not primarily a technical enterprise, although it does require skill with \"techniques'.

Major authors to be covered include Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, and the Gawain-poet.\nIn his Aeneid (written between 29 and 19 BCE), the Roman poet Virgil created the most enduring narrative of Dido, Queen of Carthage. Virgil invents the romance between Dido and the hero Aeneas, and has her kill herself when Aeneas leaves Carthage to carry out his imperial mission to Italy.

They are familiar to the point of ubiquity, beloved, demanded, simply accepted as a promise that something extraordinary is about to unfold. And, in fairy tales, something always does.\nIn this course, we will focus not on that promise (after all, it\u2019s an immutable truth), but on the less immutable \u201cHappily ever after\u201d that we expect to have follow. Because not every tale ends happily for anyone, let alone everyone. Just ask most fictional stepmothers. And even for the winner, the path is seldom smooth.\nWe will examine fairy tales and folklore across continents and centuries, considering both form and function in how they stand as both rulebook and cautionary tale, specifically as they speak to gender.

Bodies have long been the mainstay of art, but the attribution of sex to those bodies is a highly variable social phenomenon that tells us as much about the culture in question as it does about ourselves. Sex is thus in the eye of the beholder, defined by cultural, religious, scientific, and political norms, themselves often defined in and through a politics of visibility and exhibition. Beginning in the ancient world and moving into the present, this course studies the sexual politics of display, inherent but little studied, in the history of art history. From Renaissance battles over fig leaves to Enlightenment Europe\u2019s titillation at what they saw as the unbridled eroticism of the ancient world to the culture wars of today, sex has long been a hidden motor of shifts in the art world. Whether coming to understand the so-called \u201cFree Body Culture\u201d of turn of the 20th century Europe with its very public nudity,  to the explosion in nude performance in the 1960s to the culture wars of the 1980s in the USA  over an art that addressed queerness, AIDS, and their intersection, we\u2019ll see  how often exhibitions have served as proxy for other social and political issues. In this course we\u2019ll also come to understand the distinction between the nude, a category in art, and the naked, a category that was often said to corrupt art. Reading the latest work in queer, feminist and anti-racist scholarship, we will see how easily bodies on display can turn into sex, and conversely, slip as easily back from sex into bodies again.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"BCHE-4597","title":"Biochemistry Laboratory","description":"Students participate in research projects associated with the laboratories of individual faculty investigators.

In particular, we will try to answer the following questions:\n- Do humor and comedy inherently depend upon a sense of superiority? In other words, if we laugh, is it always at someone else\u2019s expense?\n- Do comedy and humor simply reinforce established social hierarchies based on race, gender, and class, or can it provide a way to challenge them?\n- What makes French and Francophone humor culturally specific?

It traces the historical trajectory, from antiquity to the present day, of the idea that there once was, and again could be, a universal and perfect language among humanity. The tantalizing question of the possibility of such a language has been a vital and thought-provoking inquiry throughout human history. If recovered or invented, such a language has the potential to explain the origins, physical reality, and meaning of human experience, fostering universal understanding and world peace. Greek philosophers grappled with the capacity of names to correctly denote things. In Judaic and Christian traditions, the notion that the language spoken by Adam and Eve perfectly expressed the nature of the physical and metaphysical world captivated the minds of intellectuals for nearly two millennia. In defiance of the biblical myth of the confusion of languages and peoples at the Tower of Babel, they persistently endeavored to overcome divine punishment and rediscover the path to harmonious life. In the 19th century, Indo-Europeanist philologists perceived an avenue to explore the early stages of human development by reconstructing a proto-language. In the 20th century, romantic idealists like the inventor of Esperanto, Ludwik Zamenhof, constructed languages to further understanding among estranged nations. For writers and poets of all times, from Cyrano de Bergerac to Velimir Khlebnikov, the concept of a universal and perfect language has served as an inexhaustible source of inspiration. Today, this idea reverberates in theories of universal and generative grammars, in the approach to English as a global language, and in various attempts to devise artificial languages, including those intended for cosmic communication.\n\tEach week, we examine a particular period and a set of theories to explore universal language projects. But above all, at the core of the course lies an examination of what language is and how it is used in human society.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"GSWS-2000","title":"Classicism & Lit Seminar","description":"This advanced seminar will examine the classical backgrounds of western medieval literature, in particular the reception of classical myth and epic in the literature of the Middle Ages. Different versions of the course will have different emphases on Greek or Latin backgrounds and on medieval literary genres. Major authors to be covered include Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, and the Gawain-poet.\nIn his Aeneid (written between 29 and 19 BCE), the Roman poet Virgil created the most enduring narrative of Dido, Queen of Carthage. Virgil invents the romance between Dido and the hero Aeneas, and has her kill herself when Aeneas leaves Carthage to carry out his imperial mission to Italy. But the figure of Dido quickly got away from Virgil\u2019s conception to establish a literary and artistic life of its own, from Ovid\u2019s treatment of Dido all the way to the twenty-first century. In this class we will trace the reception of Dido in poetry, philosophy, drama, art, opera, and dance through antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and modernity. Dido is one of the most intriguing figures in literary history, on the one hand a feminist icon from the Middle Ages onward, and on the other hand a blank surface on which to test out different narratives of womanhood, gender roles, and political power. In this class we will study many cultural remakings of Dido, including: the poetry of Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, and Christine de Pizan; the dramatic realization in Christopher Marlowe\u2019s renaissance tragedy of Dido; Purcell\u2019s opera Dido and Aeneas (1689) as well as other operas based on the Dido story; the regendering of Dido in Mark Morris\u2019 dance adaptation (1989) of Purcell\u2019s opera; and the Dido and Aeneas story in painting","prerequisites":"","course_quality":3.33,"instructor_quality":3.57,"difficulty":2.17,"work_required":2.182,"credits":1.0},{"id":"REES-0630","title":"Behind the Iron Curtain","description":"This first-year seminar provides an introduction to the histories, cultures, and societies of Central and Eastern Europe, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and the successor states of Yugoslavia.

Moreover, consumer finance comprises an enormous sector of the economy, including products like credit cards, student loans, mortgages, retail banking, insurance, and a wide variety of retirement savings vehicles and investment alternatives. Additionally, recent breakthroughs in the FinTech arena are integrating innovative approaches to help consumers. Though virtually all people use these products, many find financial decisions to be confusing and complex, rendering them susceptible to fraud and deception. As a result, government regulation plays a major role in these markets. This course intended for Penn undergraduates considers economic models of household decisions and examines evidence on how consumers are managing (and mismanaging) their finances. Although academic research has historically placed more attention on corporate finance, household finance is receiving a brighter spotlight now-- partly due to its role in the recent financial crisis.

In the case of falls or blunt traumas sustained by injuries in the military, workplaces, sports, or vehicle accidents, the cause of a TBI is clear. Other causes are unknown, and the brain injury may not be immediately obvious. Now, researchers in a range of disciplines from neuroscience to sociology are better understanding the short- and long-term effects of such injuries, whether it is a mild injury or more severe. These effects can be serious: ranging from emotional and behavioral changes, to speech, communication, and memory lapses. As we are better understanding the emotional, educational, and economic consequences of TBIs, caregivers, parents, policymakers, and patients are doing more to manage and care for those affected. In this writing seminar we will start by reading The Traumatized Brain, a book written by two neuropsychiatrists, Rao and Vaishnavi.

Globalizing economic paradigms encourage one model that, while it connects distant regions with the ease of a finger-tap, also homogenizes the world, manufacturing patterns of sameness behind simulations of diversity. Our current world-political situation encourages another model, in which fundamental differences are held to warrant the consolidation of borders between Us and Them, \"our world\" and \"theirs.\" This course begins with the proposal that there are other ways to encounter the world, that are politically compelling, ethically important, and personally enriching--and that the study of literature can help tease out these new paths. Through the idea of World Literature, this course introduces students to the appreciation and critical analysis of literary texts, with the aim of navigating calls for universality or particularity (and perhaps both) in fiction and film. \"World literature\" here refers not merely to the usual definition of \"books written in places other than the US and Europe, \"but any form of cultural production that explores and pushes at the limits of a particular world, that steps between and beyond worlds, or that heralds the coming of new worlds still within us, waiting to be born.

In others, people do not have access to basic or life-saving drugs. Individuals struggle to afford medications; whole populations are neglected, considered too poor to constitute profitable markets for the development and distribution of necessary drugs. This seminar analyzes the dynamics of the burgeoning international pharmaceutical trade and the global inequalities that emerge from and are reinforced by market-driven medicine. Questions about who will be treated and who will not filter through every phase of pharmaceutical production --from preclinical research to human testing, marketing, distribution, prescription, and consumption.  Whether considering how the pharmaceutical industry shapes popular understandings of mental illness in North America and Great Britain, how Brazil has created a model of HIV\/AIDS prevention and treatment program, or how the urban pooer in Delhi understand and access healthcare, the seminar draws on anthropological case studies to illuminate the roles of corporations, governments, non-governmental organizations, and individuals in relation to global pharmaceuticals. As we analyze each case and gain famliarity with tehnographic methods, we will ask how individual and group health is shaped by new medical technologies and their evolving regulatory regimes and markets.

The course is designed to provide information about how the field of the learning sciences emerged, has evolved, and is growing to address current and future learning needs. The learning sciences is a relatively new field of research in education that began in the late 80s. It is an interdisciplinary field consisting of researchers who study among other things, cognition, science and math education, language literacy, anthropological and sociological perspectives, computer science, and educational psychology. Learning scientists study learning as it happens in real world contexts and design resources and environments to improve learning in those contexts. This can happen in school, in informal places, at work, and online. Although the learning sciences is continually evolving, what remains true of the tenets of this educational field is that learning happens through mediated processes that most often require collaboration with others whereby learning is inextricably linked to context and culture.

The actual cost to bring a drug from the research labs to patients is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and yet only 10% of all drugs that enter human testing are ever approved, often failing due poor safety or lackluster efficacy.  Therefore, when you factor in the cost of these drug failures, the cost to get a drug approved can reach into the billions.  And that\u2019s not even considering the cost to market the drug once approved.  Despite these inherent risks and high costs of drug development and marketing, there were $500 billion of equity capital invested annually into biotech companies over the past 10 years signaling a robust market where returns are disproportionate to risk.\nThis course will explore funding these risky biotech ventures from two perspectives: the biotech CEO (primary focus of the course) and the biotech investor (secondary focus of the course).  Students will learn about the various ways biotech companies are capitalized (e.g., equity, convertible\/structured debt, licensing partnerships, clinical trial financing, royalty monetization, etc.) and the tradeoffs a biotech CEO considers when deciding which options to pursue at various stages of the company\u2019s evolution.  We will also explore first-hand how the biotech investor thinks about the firm\u2019s capital structure when deciding to make an equity investment as well as understand the quantitative (e.g., market & competitive assessments, total financing needs of the firm, NPV) and qualitative (e.g., physician\u2019s proclivity to prescribe, strength of management, etc.) diligence the biotech investor performs prior to making an investment.  For the final project, students will analyze the capital requirements for a biotech company make recommendations based on the financing options available to the firm.\nThrough readings, lectures, case studies, guest speakers, and a final project, students will learn concepts and analytical frameworks and acquire the tools and skills necessary to make important financing decisions as a biotech CEO.\nCompletion of FNCE 6110, Corporate Finance, is highly recommended by instructor. \nMBA students must request enrollment for this class through Course Match and should not use the \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d or \u201cRequest Permission\u201d functions.

Brazil is often in the news for its strides in social welfare, leading investments in the Global South, as host of the World Cup and Olympics, and, most recently, for its political instability. It is also a nation of deep contradictions, in which myth of racial democracy -- the longstanding creed that Brazilian society has escaped racial discrimination -- functions alongside pervasive social inequality, state violence, political corruption, and an unforgiving penal system.  This course examines six centuries of Brazilian history. It highlights the interplay between global events -- colonialism, slavery and emancipation, capitalism, and democratization -- and the local geographies, popular cultures, and social movements that have shaped this multi-ethnic and expansive nation. In particular, the readings will highlight Brazil's place in Latin America and the Lusophone World, as well as the ways in which Brazil stands as a counterpoint to the United States, especially in terms of the legacy of slavery and race relation. In this lecture, we will also follow the current political and economic crises unfolding in Brazil, at a moment when it has become all the more important to evaluate just how South America's largest nation has shaped and been shaped by global events.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":3.26,"instructor_quality":3.44,"difficulty":1.32,"work_required":1.53,"credits":1.0},{"id":"ESE-3040","title":"Introduction to Optimization","description":"This course is an introduction to linear optimization and its extensions emphasizing the underlying mathematical structures, geometrical ideas, algorithms and solutions of practical problems.

A diagnosis of a chronic illness is a life-changing event, causing disruption and a sense of loss for many. Common early responses are stress, anxiety, depression, fear, and anger. Over time, with support and experience with the illness, many adjust. But, others report persistent feelings of loss due to physical, emotional, spiritual\/existential, social, occupational, and\/or financial influences of chronic illness. Those who adjust the best typically find a way to return a sense of normalcy to their lives. Loved ones and caregivers are equally affected by chronic illness and much has been written in recent years about caregiver burden. However, some individuals (caregivers and patients) report positive responses to illness, including a deepened purpose for living and a reordering of life priorities. The focus of this course is on individual responses to chronic illness- the person diagnosed and his\/her loved ones. This course is intended to complement N818, which focuses on families and dyads dealing with chronic illness. In this course we will explore the major theoretical perspectives that underlie this field. The literature describing common responses of both those diagnosed and their loved ones as well as the social and cultural context that helps explain the responses of individuals facing chronic illness will be examined. Methods used to study chronic illness will be explored in depth.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":3.436,"instructor_quality":3.679,"difficulty":2.739,"work_required":2.701,"credits":1.0},{"id":"PUBH-6080","title":"Design for Health Behavior","description":"How might we get users of HIV self-tests to report their test results on a mobile app?

This course explores the answers to these questions and many more through the complementary lenses of design thinking and behavioral economics. Design thinking is a structured approach to innovation and problem solving that puts human needs at the center of solutioning. Behavioral economics, a field at the intersection of psychology and economics, helps us understand the fundamental psychological forces\u2014including cognitive biases, mental shortcuts, and inconsistent time preferences\u2014that might lead us to act against our best interest. With the theoretical insights of behavioral economics and the pragmatic, solutions-focused orientation of design thinking, we will develop and prototype desirable, feasible, and viable interventions to change health-related behaviors. Through lectures on behavioral economics theory, critical discussions of the empirical literature (including ethical and equity considerations), and hands-on practice applying human-centered design techniques to multiple design challenges, students will build relevant, practical expertise in behavioral design for public health and health care innovation.

Seminar topics vary in academic discipline but each relates back to the SNF Paideia program's core values of informed civil discourse and deliberation. Only first-year students are eligible to enroll in SNF Paideia-designated writing seminars.\nThe question \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d evokes a myriad of responses which can vary along socio-political, cultural, and economic fault-lines. We conceptualize our identities through the meanings we attach to place; conversely, we conceptualize place, geographically speaking, through the lens of our identities. For example, residents who live on the north side of a city may perceive themselves as different from residents who live on the south side of a city, and vice versa. This phenomenon of differentiated identity mediated through place occurs at a variety of geographical and regional scales, from the local to the transnational. Using Yi-Fu Tuan\u2019s Space and Place: The Perspective of Experience, this course examines how space, place, and identity rhetorically interconnect as we navigate conceptual differences to arrive at shared understandings.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":2.637,"instructor_quality":3.254,"difficulty":1.74,"work_required":2.534,"credits":1.0},{"id":"ANTH-1755","title":"Listening in Troubles Time","description":"In this course, we will explore histories and theories of listening and the power of listening as a means to connect with other times and spaces.

Local, national, and international incidents -- including those caused by natural disasters, human behavior, infrastructure failures, and acts of terror -- can pose serious threats to the health and wellness of individuals and cohort groups of community members and to the normative functioning of institutional entities. These conditions, also, within the heightened immediacy of globally interconnected electronic communications modalities, must be optimally ameliorated under compressed time pressures amidst highly volatile circumstances that can be peopled with disaffected and\/or seditious stakeholders.\nIn response to these potential threats, many entities, institutions, and educational systems have pro-actively developed strategic risk-remediation and crisis response frameworks that they attempt to implement consistently, effectively, and efficiently to maintain mission-critical functions and to restore institutional stasis after a disruption. Leaders who most consistently foment institutional resilience are those who are: (a) strategically nimble, decisive, purposeful, and optimistic; and, therefore (b) most adept at meeting the vagaries of institutional crises using critical incident response and recovery models that are optimally crafted to use the strengths of their individual and leadership team\u2019s styles and institutional culture.\nThe core goal of the Modeling Resilient Leadership through Crisis, Calamity, Calumny, and Catastrophe course is to acquaint students with categories of crises endemic to institutions, agencies, and systems; to help them understand the importance of crisis mitigation advance planning including the elements of a crisis management plan and the value of \u201ctabletop\u201d practice; to increase their knowledge of how leadership styles and characteristics contribute to leadership resilience through institutional crises, and to survey institutional crisis response variables including: threat and vulnerability analysis, crisis communications, stakeholders, and audiences.\nAll Penn graduate and professional students welcome to enroll.

The point of the course is not to simply support or deny trauma as an interpretive framework for human pain and suffering, but instead to look critically at how it emerged as an object of study for medical and scientific circles and the benefits and ramifications of those biomedical frameworks that were felt at the time and stay with us into the present. We also consider how trauma has been taken up by actors outside of medicine and science, including popular media, fiction and activist communities. Using frameworks from feminist science studies, disability studies, black studies and queer studies, alongside more traditional histories of psychiatry, medicine and technology, students think about such diverse topics as sexual violence, racial violence, domestic and familial abuse, theories of psychological development, memory and trust, citizenship, the criminal justice system, the effects of our environments, intergenerational effects of violence, embodiment, biomedical models of risk and disease and narratives of the self. At the heart of this course is an interest in how we should understand humans\u2019 capacity to harm and be harmed by one another, and how we can attend to the enduring effects of inequality and structural violence while remaining firmly grounded in the day-to-day lived, felt realities of violence and interpersonal harm.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"HSOC-0490","title":"Comparative Medicine","description":"This course explores the medical consequences of the interaction between Europe and the \"non- West.\" It focuses on three parts of the world Europeans colonized: Africa, South Asia, and Latin America.

The racial disparities that mark this carceral regime have led scholars to describe the prison industrial complex as a new form of Jim Crow. Philadelphia has one of the highest incarceration rates in the country, and one of the largest populations on parole and probation. This class explores structural and individual-level pathways to re-engage the vast population of recently incarcerated people who cycle through prisons, jails, juvenile homes, and other detention centers. Drawing on practice informed by critical race, postcolonial, feminist, and queer theories, the class prepares the conceptual and practice foundations for a prison abolitionist orientation in social work engagement with this community. Utilizing a daily workshop format that incorporates members of the Philadelphia decarcerate landscape, students will be trained in direct and macro practice, to engage with people and the carceral systems they are embedded in. The class will engage students with the innovative psychotherapeutic and macro practices being implemented in the Center for Carceral Communities at SP2, alternative programs in Philadelphia\u2019s municipal and federal courts, educational degree programs at community colleges in Philadelphia, co-operative business initiatives for people emerging from incarceration, and social movements such as Black Lives Matter that are shaping the prison abolition landscape. The class blends morning sessions dedicated to discussions of texts with afternoon sessions dedicated to hands-on implementation workshops. At the end of the class, students will be prepared to immediately start engaging with members of the community emerging from incarceration.\nMSW Clinical and Macro Elective.  1-week intensive: December 16th -December 20th. 8:30am to 4:30pm.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"WRIT-0110","title":"Writing Sem Global Engl","description":"This writing seminar focuses on a scholarly inquiry in the field of Global English, the study of the emergence of English as a global language in the late 20th century into the present.

We will discuss concepts such as imagination, entertainment, escapism, world-building, cognitive estrangement, and the grotesque BOTH as vital forces that inform and shape our relationship to the world, AND as tactics to be cultivated through practice and deployed by skilled craftspeople. We begin from the position that content is inseparable from aesthetic, that language is as important to the vitality of speculative fiction as to any other mode of writing, and furthermore that all language is political and thus encodes something urgent about the moment from which it emerges. We will particularly examine how genre, low culture, and nonrealism have been used as strategies for subversion and resistance.

Key topics include the influence of media on public fear and perception of crime, the portrayal of children, women, police, and minority groups, and the comparative analysis of crime news across different countries. The course also investigates the role of media in political discourse and its impact on voter beliefs, as well as media coverage of white-collar crime and anti-corruption efforts. Through critical examination of police, courts, and prisons as depicted in the media, students will gain insights into how these institutions are both represented and scrutinized in public discourse. This course provides a comprehensive understanding of the symbiotic relationship between crime and media, emphasizing critical thinking and analytical skills. By the end of the unit students should be able to 1) Assess the role of news sources and news values in producing crime news, 2) Evaluate crime news in historical context and as a sociocultural product, 3) Analyze and theorize the representation of offenders, victims, and criminal justice agencies in the mass media, 4) Engage with a range of theoretical and conceptual explanations for media renderings of crime and criminal justice, and 5) Evaluate fictional representations of crime and criminal justice by locating them historically, culturally, and socially.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"ENMG-5400","title":"Net-zero Technology Deployment","description":"This course covers the levers within government (policy, regulatory agencies, legislation) and outside of government (communities, businesses, NGOs.)

To meet our net-zero goals in time, we must scale up deployment for deep decarbonization in parallel with the annual removal of gigatons of carbon dioxide from the accumulating pool in the atmosphere. There are, however, multiple barriers to deployment: high costs for first-of-a-kind technology demonstrations; lack of policy frameworks across the broad portfolio of approaches that enable nth-of-a-kind technologies to become universally affordable; and a lack of public acceptance of energy technologies in environmentally impacted communities.

Off-site, fused granulate fabrication (FGF) additive manufacturing is being used to produce large thermoplastic components that are crafted from materials already utilized for building facades, roofing and interiors, or in precast concrete mold applications. While FGF offers exciting possibilities, it is presently under-explored within architectural research and practice. Robotic Approaches to Spatial 3D Printing, explores non-standard approaches to Industrial Robot FGF. While 3D prints are typically manufactured in horizontal layers, this seminar utilizes six-axis industrial robots to transcend this limitation. By 3D printing in diverse orientations and configurations, free-form material deposition and scalable, hybrid fabrication techniques become possible. Exploring these exciting capabilities, participants will master cutting-edge manufacturing and 3D workflows for industrial robot FGF. Lectures, tutorials, and hands-on sessions support students working in teams on the development of an experimental, robotically fabricated prototype. Operating primarily from the Weitzman School of Design\u2019s ARI Robotics Lab, students will gain state-of-the-art knowledge in robotic fabrication techniques that are currently expanding and recalibrating contemporary architectural design and manufacturing possibilities.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"BE-2000","title":"Intro To Biomechanics","description":"This course investigates the application of statics and strength of materials to soft and hard biologic tissues.

These narratives tend to emphasize the large-scale processes that played out over these centuries, such as the florescence and fragmentation of two world empires; the emergence of two highly influential monotheistic religions of the book; and the codification of legal systems that continue to dominate contemporary practices and theories of law. Equally, what characterizes these centuries is the particular granularity and character of the textual and archaeological evidence that exists for the functioning of this world at the micro-scale, as against the periods that preceded and followed. This course traces the social, economic, cultural, and religious institutions and processes that make this period distinctive, explores the nature of the evidence for those institutions and processes, and exposes to scrutiny the assumptions and preconceptions that underpin the scholarly narratives that have been  constructed about them.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"SPAN-3600","title":"Studies in Span\/Ltam\/Ltx Cin","description":"This course explores fundamental aspects of Spanish, Latin American, and Latinx cinema.

From early cinema, German Expressionism, the Soviet Montage, various new wave movements signaled by the Italian Neo-Realism, to contemporary movements such as Iranian New Wave, Taiwanese New Wave, and Korean New Wave, we will follow diverse cinematic trajectories from around the globe, as well as their interconnectedness. The goal is to cover a broad historical, cultural, thematic and stylistic range, but also to explore longer, pre-cinematic histories of regional and national traditions, and their connection to other artforms (opera, theater, painting) that had profound influence on the evolution of cinematic medium. The history of cinema will thus be approached as an intermedial history, which tends to blur the divides between old and new media, theatrical, painterly and photographic, foreign and national styles, conceiving of art in its hybrid and \u201cimpure\u201d manifestation. We will also explore numerous ways the medium of film has played an active role in, narrated, and shaped history. Finally, we will examine how the concept of \u201cworld cinema history\u201d gets shaped as a discursive construct, determining both major and minor cinematic flows.

In this course, we will explore the ways in which American schools have been molded by the social, political, economic, cultural, and ideological forces in society at large. By historically linking the development of educational initiatives to notions of power, nation building, and citizenship, this class furthers an understanding of the assumptions about the purpose of education within this democratic nation, and its role(s) within our current social and political climate. Additionally, we will explore how the work of teaching can support transformation, rather than reproduction, of these macro-level injustices and inequities. We will draw on students' experiential knowledge of schools and teaching to imagine how urban educators can transform the socially reproductive practices of schools. The work of increasing access to opportunity has been a path walked by educators, individually and collectively, and schools, by leaders and as organizations, and by reformers.

These rivers historically provided drinking water, food, power, trade routes, and recreation. Human development, however, has led to flooding, erosion and pollution; these factors degrade the ability of rivers to provide ecological habitat, and ultimately may turn rivers from a resource into a hazard. Unfortunately, lower income neighborhoods often bear the brunt of these negative impacts. In the face of climate change, extreme floods and erosion are only getting worse. The news, however, is not all bad. With improving understanding of environmental science and engineering, techniques that counteract flooding and clean up waterways are being developed and deployed. Armed with knowledge of science, citizens can become agents of change in their communities.\nIt is in this context that we propose a partnership among Sayre High School, Penn\u2019s Netter Center, and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, to develop an Academically Based Community Service (ABCS) course on \u201cRivers in a changing world\u201d. We seek to take advantage of the newly refurbished Cobbs Creek Environmental Center, which will host a brand new environmental laboratory space. A Project for Progress award from Penn has provided additional funding for state of the art equipment, including a \u201cstream table\u201d; this is a laboratory river that allows interactive and discovery-driven learning. The unique setting of an environmental river laboratory that is just steps from a natural river (Cobbs Creek), and close to Sayre High School, presents a special opportunity for meaningful hands-on learning of Sayre students in collaboration with Penn undergraduates. Course material will be co-developed between Sayre and Penn participants, so that learning modules in the laboratory and natural river are connected to curriculum objectives. Sayre is a Netter Center university-assisted community school and Mr. Smith has worked with Penn students in his classrooms for many years. He has a desire to bring students to the Cobbs Creek Environmental Education Center for hands-on real world environmental education and problem solving. Therefore, this is an ideal partnership for this ABCS course.

Grading - the shaping and sculpting of the landform - is both art and science, and thus Workshop II aims to provide an appreciation of landform as an evocative component in the design vocabulary as well as a critical tool in solving difficult design problems. The basic techniques and strategies of grading design (slopes, terraces, water management, grade change devices) will be introduced, practiced and reinforced, so that grading design becomes an integral part of the students' design approach. Lecture, field trips, modeling, in-class exercises, and group projects will be used. The Planting component provides students with a working overview of the principles and processes of planting design. Plants will be considered both as individual elements and as part of larger dynamic systems. The natural distribution of plants, concepts of plant community and successional patterns, and the relationship of planting an topography will be used as the initial framework for planting design. Planting design typologies will be examined as an outgrowth of these \"natural\" patterns.

In fact the concepts of modern art and homosexuality that we use today are twins, for they were both founded in the third quarter of the 19th century and grew up together. Introduction to Queer Art thus begins with the coining of the word \"homosexual\" in 1869, and surveys how a range of mediums including painting, sculpture, poetry, music, and film shifted in response to new definitions of sexuality. Along the way, we will work towards answering two related questions: 1) Why were queer creators largely responsible for the introduction of modernity in the arts, and 2) why do we find so often that queer social and political dissent found form in, and as, aesthetic dissent as well? In creating new forms for art that often seem far removed from any traditional definition of sexuality, including non-objective and abstract art, queer artists pushed the boundaries of normativity, leading to new ways of seeing, hearing, feeling and thinking that often dared to encode queer meanings as part of their formal innovation. We will look into the politics of queer art, and how and why in the US, even amidst often dangerous homophobia, it was queer artists who represented America to itself. Thus, we will cover such key cultural figures such as Walt Whitman, Gertrude Stein, Georgia O'Keeffe, Frank O'Hara, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, and Agnes Martin. Throughout, new methods informed by queer, gender, and critical race theory will be utilized.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":3.575,"instructor_quality":3.54,"difficulty":2.49,"work_required":2.245,"credits":1.0},{"id":"CIS-4410","title":"Embedded Software","description":"The goal of this course is to give students greater design and implementation experience in embedded software development and to teach them how to model, design, verify, and validate safety critical systems in a principled manner.

How did this term, first used to describe a controversial movement in French painting, quickly become a keyword in literature and other media? In fiction, is realism a question of subject matter or of style and form? What modes of perception, ways of knowing, aesthetic values, or attitudes toward the world does realist representation entail? How does it relate to probability, empiricism, and historical time; to topics like money, marriage, and social norms; to ideas of ordinariness or \u201cthe everyday\u201d as they shape character, setting, and plot; or to frameworks like the domestic sphere, the nation-state, empire, and the global market? What happens when we apply the concept of realism forward or backward in time, or when it moves across geographies and cultural contexts? In this seminar we can approach these and other questions partly by examining realist novels and other artworks, and partly by considering some categories and genres that realism seems to oppose (romance, the Gothic, idealism, sentimentalism, melodrama, sensationalism, utopia), as well as movements like naturalism and modernism that questioned realism\u2019s claims to artistic truth.

Why should abstract sequences of sounds give us such strong emotional reactions? Why indeed should they give us any emotional reaction at all? On every continent, today and throughout history, there is not a single human culture that has ever been described that does not make music. Within cultures, music is so ubiquitous that we actually have clinical terms (amusia and musical anhedonia) to describe people who don't understand or don't enjoy music. And yet, despite this ubiquity, the evolutionary origin and purpose of music remains unknown. Not only do people everywhere make music - they do so in fundamentally similar ways. All over the world people divide rhythm into twos and threes; all over the world people divide the frequency spectrum logarithmically, in octaves; with a very few exceptions, we divide octaves into no more than 12 steps, and we use subsets of 5-7 of these tones at a time. Not only that, but many cultures seem to have independently arrived at the same sets of 5-7 notes. These are probably not coincidences. If not coincidence, then what? In this course we look for explanations to these and other questions about music by looking at something that humans all over the globe have in common: the brain. Using readings  from the primary literature and classic texts, supplemented with software exercises and analysis, we will see how many of the age-old mysteries and questions of music can be either answered or in some cases amplified by a consideration of brain mechanisms. Thinking about music in the context of brain function also provides a biological and evolutionary rationale not just for why music is the way it is, but why it should exist at all. More broadly, this course is an example of what can (and cannot) be accomplished by addressing aesthetic and philosophical questions as scientific and empirical ones.

This Benjamin Franklin Seminar offers students a semester-long immersion in Woolf\u2019s life and writings while also attending closely to the historical contexts of both. It introduces students, in addition, to the large and rapidly growing body of scholarship on Woolf through two major writing assignments: a book review of a recent scholarly monograph or edition; and a research paper on some focused topic, theme, or question. Both majors and non-majors should emerge from the course better able to learn their way around a given cultural figure\u2019s life and oeuvre. And they should be equipped to connect such a figure to contemporary individuals, communities, and historical energies and to navigate her cultural legacy and scholarly archive in pursuit of their own research questions. As a way of delving into Woolf\u2019s legacy, we will also read two recent works: \u2018\/Of One Woman or So\/ by Olivia N\u2019Gowfri,\u2019 a novella that Kabe Wilson created in 2014 by resequencing every word in Woolf\u2019s \/A Room of One\u2019s Own\/; and \/LOTE\/, Shola von Reinhold\u2019s 2020 novel about the \u201cBright Young Things\u201d of the wider Bloomsbury circle, in which dark academia meets Black trans joy.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":3.396,"instructor_quality":3.598,"difficulty":2.855,"work_required":2.866,"credits":1.0},{"id":"COML-1130","title":"Water Worlds","description":"As a result of climate change, the world that will take shape in the course of this century will be decidedly more inundated with water than we're accustomed to.

Should there be a canon? And if so, which texts and scholars would we regard as canonic to the field? In 2002, Elihu Katz et al. answered these questions with a book that mapped five schools of thought - Columbia, Frankfurt, Chicago, Toronto, and Birmingham (British Cultural Studies) - and explored how they came to define areas of research and shape the formation of distinct scholarly communities. Yet two decades ago, media and communication studies scholars were only beginning to take seriously the critiques and interventions being developed by scholars of race, gender, and postcoloniality. Now, students and scholars in media studies and other allied disciplines in the humanities and interpretive social sciences are grappling with the epistemic, ideological, and moral flaws of Eurocentric thought and in the process, re-vitalizing keywords, concepts, and theories.\nIn this seminar, we will read and engage with canonic texts, delve into the historical conditions of the production of those texts, their afterlife and varied impact(s) on the field, and engage with critical responses that help recast their theoretical and analytic value for us today.

Others still set out to imitate photography\u2019s descriptive capacity in their prose or to reveal aspects of reality that the camera cannot hope to capture.

Methods for estimating total causal effects in the context of both point and time-varying exposure will be discussed, including regression-based methods, propensity score techniques and instrumental variable techniques for continuous, discrete, binary and time to event outcomes. Mediation analysis will be discussed from a counterfactual perspective. Causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and associated nonparametric structural equations models (NPSEMs) will be used to formalize identification of causal effects for static and dynamic longitudinal treatment regimes  under unconfoundedness and unmeasured confounding settings.\nThis formalization will be used to define, identify and make inferences about the joint effects of time-varying exposures in the presence of (possibly hidden) time-dependent covariates that are simultaneously confounders and intermediate variables. These methods include g-estimation of structural nested models, inverse probability weighted estimators of marginal structural models, and g-computation algorithm estimators. Credible quasi-experimental causal inference methods will be described,  leveraging auxiliary variables such as instrumental variables, negative control variables, or more broadly confounding proxy variables. Quasi-experimental methods discussed will include the control outcome calibration approach, proximal causal inference, difference-in-differences and related generalizations of these methods.

As the world's fifth-largest country, by size and population, and the ninth-largest by GDP, Brazil exerts tremendous influence on international politics and the global economy, seen in its position as an emerging BRIC nation and a regional heavyweight in South America. Brazil is often in the news for its strides in social welfare, leading investments in the Global South, as host of the World Cup and Olympics, and, most recently, for its political instability. It is also a nation of deep contradictions, in which myth of racial democracy -- the longstanding creed that Brazilian society has escaped racial discrimination -- functions alongside pervasive social inequality, state violence, political corruption, and an unforgiving penal system.  This course examines six centuries of Brazilian history. It highlights the interplay between global events -- colonialism, slavery and emancipation, capitalism, and democratization -- and the local geographies, popular cultures, and social movements that have shaped this multi-ethnic and expansive nation. In particular, the readings will highlight Brazil's place in Latin America and the Lusophone World, as well as the ways in which Brazil stands as a counterpoint to the United States, especially in terms of the legacy of slavery and race relation.

This sets in motion a virtuous cycle - the entrepreneur is incented to generate more profits and in so doing, the more the profits made, the more the problem is alleviated. Even if it is not possible to eventually create a profit-making enterprise, the process of striving to do so can lead to a resource-lean not-for-profit entity.

War poses problems of perception, knowledge, and language. The notional \"fog of war\" describes a disturbing discrepancy between agents and actions of war; the extreme nature of the violence of warfare tests the limits of cognition, emotion, and memory; war's traditional dependence on declaration is often warped by language games--\"police action,\" \"military intervention,\" \"nation-building,\" or palpably unnamed and unacknowledged state violence. Faced with the radical uncertainty that forms of war bring, modern and contemporary authors have experimented in historically, geographically, experientially and artistically particular ways, forcing us to reconsider even seemingly basic definitions of what a war story can be. Where does a war narrative happen? On the battlefield, in the internment camp, in the suburbs, in the ocean, in the ruins of cities, in the bloodstream? Who narrates war? Soldiers, refugees, gossips, economists, witnesses, bureaucrats, survivors, children, journalists, descendants and inheritors of trauma, historians, those who were never there? How does literature respond to the rise of terrorist or ideology war, the philosophical and material consequences of biological and cyber wars, the role of the nuclear state?  How does the problem of war and representation disturb the difference between fiction and non-fiction? How do utilitarian practices of representation--propaganda, nationalist messaging, memorialization, xenophobic depiction--affect the approaches we use to study art? Finally, is it possible to read a narrative barely touched or merely contextualized by war and attend to the question of war's shaping influence?

These institutions and sites often claim to represent our past, who we imagine ourselves to be today, and how we might define our futures. We often rely on museums and monuments to frame history and history\u2019s relationship to our current social and cultural systems. However, in recent years, social, racial, and economic justice movements have pushed us to rethink the function of monuments, museums, and heritage. In particular, these social movements have helped us understand how racism, sexism, and colonialism are responsible for the creation of monuments and museums. This course examines the echoes and continuities of colonial representations in museums and monuments. In addition, we will examine how new ways of commemorating and representing the past can result in a new vision for our future. By visiting a variety of local monuments and sites and by engaging in conversations about accountability and social justice, this course will challenge us to rethink the tangible and intangible ways that we weave the past into the present for the creation of the future.\nHere in Philadelphia today, we continue to grapple with historical monuments including statues of Frank Rizzo and Christopher Columbus.

These narratives tend to emphasize the large-scale processes that played out over these centuries, such as the florescence and fragmentation of two world empires; the emergence of two highly influential monotheistic religions of the book; and the codification of legal systems that continue to dominate contemporary practices and theories of law. Equally, what characterizes these centuries is the particular granularity and character of the textual and archaeological evidence that exists for the functioning of this world at the micro-scale, as against the periods that preceded and followed.

Part of the attraction of reality TV is that it is \"unscripted.\" But in this course, we will examine the powerful cultural scripts that reality TV programming helps to create around identity, especially identities related to gender and race. Using Rachel Dubrofsky's scholarly monograph The Surveillance of Women on Reality TV: Watching The Bachelor and The Bachelorette as a starting point, we will consider how gender, race, sexual orientation, and class are represented in reality television. What does the new Netflix series Bling Empire tell its audience about Asian American identity; how does Queer Eye represent queer male friendship? What about representations of (dis)ability in Love on the Spectrum? How do these representations impact gendered and racialized bodies?

It traces the historical trajectory, from antiquity to the present day, of the idea that there once was, and again could be, a universal and perfect language among humanity. The tantalizing question of the possibility of such a language has been a vital and thought-provoking inquiry throughout human history. If recovered or invented, such a language has the potential to explain the origins, physical reality, and meaning of human experience, fostering universal understanding and world peace. Greek philosophers grappled with the capacity of names to correctly denote things. In Judaic and Christian traditions, the notion that the language spoken by Adam and Eve perfectly expressed the nature of the physical and metaphysical world captivated the minds of intellectuals for nearly two millennia. In defiance of the biblical myth of the confusion of languages and peoples at the Tower of Babel, they persistently endeavored to overcome divine punishment and rediscover the path to harmonious life. In the 19th century, Indo-Europeanist philologists perceived an avenue to explore the early stages of human development by reconstructing a proto-language. In the 20th century, romantic idealists like the inventor of Esperanto, Ludwik Zamenhof, constructed languages to further understanding among estranged nations. For writers and poets of all times, from Cyrano de Bergerac to Velimir Khlebnikov, the concept of a universal and perfect language has served as an inexhaustible source of inspiration. Today, this idea reverberates in theories of universal and generative grammars, in the approach to English as a global language, and in various attempts to devise artificial languages, including those intended for cosmic communication.\n\tEach week, we examine a particular period and a set of theories to explore universal language projects. But above all, at the core of the course lies an examination of what language is and how it is used in human society.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"ENGL-7760","title":"Partition in South Asia","description":"This course examines the ways in which imaginative literature and film have addressed the difficult sociopolitical issues leading up to, and following from, the independence and partition of British India.

Poe's multiple legacies (gothic fiction, ghost story, whodunit, medical fantasy, adventure tale) were extended and developed in the nineteenth century, then elevated by modernist writers into the basis for a self-consciously artistic form that blends outward adventure with psychological insight, climax with anti-climax -- while keeping the action within a single, compact frame. The first half of the twentieth-century saw some of the greatest short-story writing of the modern period, vivid with new experiences and alive with stylistic experimentation. In this seminar, we will read stories and story-sequences by James Joyce, William Faulkner, Franz Kafka, Katherine Mansfield, Sherwood Anderson, and Jean Rhys.

This creates the risk that financial goals will play an outsized role in decision-making, particularly as the venture scales, leading founders to drift away from social impact aims - or to pursue goals that fail to deliver on their intended impacts. MGMT 401 fulfils the Wharton capstone requirement with a hands-on approach to addressing these issues. Students will work hand-in-hand with the founding teams of pre-selected startups from the Wharton venture community to develop a strategy for measuring social impact, and ensuring fidelity to social goals as the venture goes to market and begins to scale. Projects will be group-based, and will ask students to integrate learnings on social enterprise, impact measurement, and impact investing, with prior coursework on entrepreneurship, social impact, business ethics, leadership, team dynamics, and venture finance. Students will leave the class with a deeper appreciation of the potential for business to be a force for good in the world, and the difficulties that this can pose during the founding and growth stages of a new business. The class will be of value to students who are interested in creating socially impactful businesses, as well as to those who want to work in the ecosystem that supports such ventures (e.g., consulting, or impact investing).","prerequisites":"","course_quality":2.707,"instructor_quality":3.237,"difficulty":1.563,"work_required":2.07,"credits":0.5},{"id":"CIS-1600","title":"Math Found Comp Sci","description":"What are the basic mathematical concepts and techniques needed in computer science?

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), which utilizes secularized practices from Asian and South Asian traditions for the remediation of various health concerns, has revolutionized behavioral medicine, and the scientific evaluation of MBSR has shed new light on the biomechanical pathways linking mind and body. This course will 1) explore fundamental principles underlying mindfulness, 2) the scientific data on its effects, and 3) the ways in which mindfulness is being applied to clinical and educational settings to support healthy human development. Contemplative practices include all forms of meditation, including contemplative dimensions of yoga, tai chi, qigong and other mind-body wellness activities. By far the most well known contemplative practice in the U.S. today is \"mindfulness.\" Mindfulness meditation was introduced into clinical medicine in the 1980's in the form of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) by Jon Kabat-Zinn and his colleagues at U Mass; since that time it has had a significant impact on psychoneuroimmunology, clinical medicine, and especially behavioral medicine. Both psychological theory and practice have slowly been transformed by new findings emerging from mindfulness research. Brain imaging studies of persons engaged in meditation suggest that focused mental activities can actually change cerebral blood flow (Newberg et al 2010), brain morphology and neural circuitry, in addition to strengthening the immune system (Davidson et al 2003) and improving attention skills (Jha et al 2007). MBSR has been repeatedly documented to be effective in treating mental health problems, particularly depression and anxiety, in numerous adult populations (Goyal et al 2014).

Globalizing economic paradigms encourage one model that, while it connects distant regions with the ease of a finger-tap, also homogenizes the world, manufacturing patterns of sameness behind simulations of diversity. Our current world-political situation encourages another model, in which fundamental differences are held to warrant the consolidation of borders between Us and Them, \"our world\" and \"theirs.\" This course begins with the proposal that there are other ways to encounter the world, that are politically compelling, ethically important, and personally enriching--and that the study of literature can help tease out these new paths. Through the idea of World Literature, this course introduces students to the appreciation and critical analysis of literary texts, with the aim of navigating calls for universality or particularity (and perhaps both) in fiction and film. \"World literature\" here refers not merely to the usual definition of \"books written in places other than the US and Europe, \"but any form of cultural production that explores and pushes at the limits of a particular world, that steps between and beyond worlds, or that heralds the coming of new worlds still within us, waiting to be born.

For this course, social entrepreneurship is defined as entrepreneurship used to profitably confront social problems. This definition therefore views social entrepreneurship as a distinct alternative to public sector initiatives. The basic thesis is that many social problems, if looked at through an entrepreneurial lens, create opportunity for someone to launch a venture that generates profits by alleviating that social problem. This sets in motion a virtuous cycle - the entrepreneur is incented to generate more profits and in so doing, the more the profits made, the more the problem is alleviated. Even if it is not possible to eventually create a profit-making enterprise, the process of striving to do so can lead to a resource-lean not-for-profit entity.

We also consider how trauma has been taken up by actors outside of medicine and science, including popular media, fiction and activist communities. Using frameworks from feminist science studies, disability studies, black studies and queer studies, alongside more traditional histories of psychiatry, medicine and technology, students think about such diverse topics as sexual violence, racial violence, domestic and familial abuse, theories of psychological development, memory and trust, citizenship, the criminal justice system, the effects of our environments, intergenerational effects of violence, embodiment, biomedical models of risk and disease and narratives of the self.

War poses problems of perception, knowledge, and language. The notional \"fog of war\" describes a disturbing discrepancy between agents and actions of war; the extreme nature of the violence of warfare tests the limits of cognition, emotion, and memory; war's traditional dependence on declaration is often warped by language games--\"police action,\" \"military intervention,\" \"nation-building,\" or palpably unnamed and unacknowledged state violence. Faced with the radical uncertainty that forms of war bring, modern and contemporary authors have experimented in historically, geographically, experientially and artistically particular ways, forcing us to reconsider even seemingly basic definitions of what a war story can be. Where does a war narrative happen? On the battlefield, in the internment camp, in the suburbs, in the ocean, in the ruins of cities, in the bloodstream? Who narrates war? Soldiers, refugees, gossips, economists, witnesses, bureaucrats, survivors, children, journalists, descendants and inheritors of trauma, historians, those who were never there? How does literature respond to the rise of terrorist or ideology war, the philosophical and material consequences of biological and cyber wars, the role of the nuclear state?  How does the problem of war and representation disturb the difference between fiction and non-fiction? How do utilitarian practices of representation--propaganda, nationalist messaging, memorialization, xenophobic depiction--affect the approaches we use to study art? Finally, is it possible to read a narrative barely touched or merely contextualized by war and attend to the question of war's shaping influence? The class will concentrate on literary objects--short stories, and graphic novels--as well as film and television.

As a class, we aim to establish and maintain a space where students can develop ethical reasoning skills and debate controversial topics within genetics and ethics. Class time will be devoted to short lectures and selected video excerpts, student presentations, and extensive discussion with genetic counselors from a variety of subspecialities about ethics cases and associated assignments that represent the diverse perspectives of different authors.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"BIOE-9990","title":"Master of Bioethics Ind.

To learn more about this course, visit the Creative Writing Program at https:\/\/creative.writing.upenn.edu.\nEvery work of nonfiction is a writer\u2019s attempt to reconstruct experience. But experience can be an elusive thing to capture: a strange hybrid of the highly subjective and the more tangible zone of perceptible fact. How do we strike a balance in narrative nonfiction? For one, we employ the same devices that we already use to navigate our way through the world\u2014that of our senses. The more vivid the details of sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound, the more immersed the reader will become in the author\u2019s re-created world of words. But what of the more abstract, less concrete sixth sense of thought? After all, it is our mind that perceives and finds the subjective meaning in experience. In this narrative nonfiction writing workshop, we will look at craft, literary technique, the mechanics of building vivid and powerful scenes, discuss the role of story-logic, and the importance of hard fact-checking. Yet, the student is also urged to pay close attention to their own internal narrator, and to be mindful of the intuitive (and unconscious) powers at play in their writing. Each week we will review classics in the genre, do in-class writing exercises, go on periodic \u201cexperiential\u201d assignments, and explore how the art of playing around with the raw material of everyday life (i.e., \u201creality\u201d) can make for great and unexpected stories.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":3.1,"instructor_quality":3.2,"difficulty":1.44,"work_required":1.56,"credits":1.0},{"id":"BEPP-4010","title":"Public Policy Analysis","description":"BEPP 4010 fulfills the Wharton capstone requirement by giving students an opportunity to apply their skills to assess a vital public policy question at the local, state, national, or global level.

No previous experience required, just curiosity and willingness to engage. In this intergenerational seminar, Penn students together with older community members read groundbreaking playwright August Wilson's American Century Cycle: ten plays that form an iconic picture of African American traditions, traumas, and triumphs through the decades, nearly all told through the lens of Pittsburgh's Hill District neighborhood. (Two of Wilson\u2019s plays are receiving fresh attention with recent acclaimed film versions: Fences with Denzel Washington and Viola Davis; Ma Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom with Davis and Chadwick Boseman.) Class participants develop relationships with one other while exploring the history and culture that shaped these powerful plays.\nAs an Academically Based Community Service (ABCS) course, the class plans and hosts events for a multigenerational, West Philadelphia-focused audience with community partners West Philadelphia Cultural Alliance \/ Paul Robeson House & Museum, and Theatre in the X. Class members come to a deeper understanding of Black life in Philadelphia through stories community members share in oral history interviews. These stories form the basis for an original performance the class creates, presented at an end-of-semester gathering. Wilson's plays provide the bridge between class members from various generations and backgrounds.

Economics allows us to predict how policy is likely to affect behavior by understanding how the policy changes individuals' decisions, and what collective outcomes these myriad individual decisions bring about. For example, a universal basic income allows individuals to sustain themselves and their families when they are not working. At the same time, such guaranteed income has the potential to discourage people from looking for a job. If enough people are discouraged from looking for a job, employment in the economy will decrease, leading to lower production and lower tax revenues for the government. Policy makers have to take these phenomena into account in order to design a good income support system.\nEnrollment is restricted to SP2 PhD Students.\n","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"MUSC-2400","title":"Musical Life in America","description":"This course surveys American musical life from the colonial period to the present.

It provides a critical survey of the field of comparative politics, tracing the intellectual history of the field, examining shifts in conceptual frameworks and research traditions, and comparing alternative methodological approaches. The first half of the course generally examines how processes of political, economic, and social change have been theorized in the social sciences from the mid-19th century to the present. In this process, particular attention is paid to the bifurcation between theories that emphasize the \"universal\" (e.g. the homogenizing effects of specific processes or variables) and the \"particular\" (e.g. the persistence of distinctive historical legacies and trajectories). Since this bifurcation is reinforced by distinct styles and methods of research, the seminar also probes the recent battles between rational-choice, cultural, and structuralist scholars, while considering the trade-offs between varieties of formal, quantitative, and qualitative methods. In the second half, the focus shifts to the range of substantive problems investigated by scholars in the field of comparative politics.  These topics cover the complex relations among nations, states and societies; the origins, consolidation, and patterns of democratic governance; political economy in relation to development processes and social policies; the intersection of international\/global economy and domestic politics; the dynamics of revolutions and social movements; and alternative problematiques constructed from the point of view of real actors such as workers, women, and local communities. In all cases, As a whole, the course is designed to provide an introduction to important issues and debates that comparativists have regularly engaged in; to help you understand the assumptions behind, and differences between, particular approaches, methods, and styles of research; to examine whether current debates are spurring new or better research in a given field in light of past approaches; and to gauge whether there has been progress, fragmentation, or stagnation in the field of comparative politics as a whole.\nThis seminar is the first in a two-course sequence aimed primarily at PhD students planning to take the comprehensive exam in comparative politics. The course is designed (1) to provide a critical survey of the subfield of comparative politics, its intellectual history, and alternative methodological approaches and research designs; and (2) to expose students to the range of substantive topics studied by comparativists. Over the course of the two semesters, students will gain a broad understanding of the field of comparative politics and begin to develop their own research projects.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"URBS-2900","title":"Metropolitan Nature","description":"In order to understand the complex and often skewed relationship between the built and natural systems, we must think in processes and examine different scales simultaneously.

This course will challenge students to consider the ways in which design decisions negatively impact black, indigenous, and other people of color, while also causing harm to the environment. The extraction of raw materials for production often leads to the displacement of communities, destruction of habitats and ecosystems, and the depletion of finite natural resources. Historically, urban planning and design has been used to enforce racial segregation and deny access to services and amenities to non-whites. The siting of toxic waste facilities, highways, and industrial zones in low-income communities of color has had devastating impacts on public health and quality of life. Probing the intersectional relationships between design, race, and climate change, students will engage with a range of texts, multimedia content, case studies, and hands-on projects.

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\nPsychoanalysis is not only a powerful therapeutic modality for numerous psychological stresses and disorders, it\u2019s also a comprehensive way of looking at the world: a way of understanding 1) the roles that emotions play in all aspects of our lives; 2) the enormous influence of childhood experiences and early development on our later friendships, romantic relationships, sexual experiences, and other personal, familial, cultural, and professional bonds; and 3) the rich and complex meanings of our social and aesthetic experiences (e.g., going to college, playing a sport, reading a book, taking a vacation, having a baby or a dog, creating a company or a garden, etc.). The theory and practice of psychoanalysis, from Sigmund Freud to the present day, is based fundamentally on the importance of unconscious processes and the complex ways in which those processes affect our lived experience: in childhood development and family relationships; in our wishes, dreams, and fantasies; in our experiences of work, play, love, sex, trauma, and loss; and in our creative, spiritual, and political strivings.

Explanations for homelessness have also been varied, and the second part of the course focuses on examining the merits of some of those explanations, and in particular, the role of the affordable housing crisis. The third section of the course focuses on the dynamics of homelessness, combining evidence from ethnographic studies of how people become homeless and experience homelessness, with quantitative research on the patterns of entry and exit from the condition. The final section of the course turns to the approaches taken by policymakers and advocates to address the problem, and considers the efficacy and quandaries associated with various policy strategies. The course concludes by contemplating the future of homelessness research and public policy.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":3.157,"instructor_quality":3.473,"difficulty":2.161,"work_required":2.471,"credits":1.0},{"id":"GRMN-0400","title":"Intermediate German II","description":"A continuation of GRMN 0300.

Alternating between creative writing workshops and critical discussions, the course will also study the political and geographical frames that shape each text. For example, our translations of Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire will be informed by his scholarship on colonialism, and a sense of China's Cultural Revolution will contextualize translations of Shu Ting. Conversations about history will become conversations about poetry. While essays on translation theory by writers including Borges, Keene, Carson, Benjamin, and Bakhtin will shape our approaches, this course will center around the practice of translation. Using multiple translations of major poems, we will create our own new versions, sometimes writing parallel texts and adaptations, too.

This course allows for the study of the Muslim world between the years1700 to present. The class will allow students to compare and contrast Muslim societies over the last three centuries, examine points of confluence for geographically- or culturally- distinct Muslim peoples in the last three centuries, and in their writing assignments focus on the history of one society in a wider Islamicate context. In the process students will gain a more nuanced awareness of how Islam has made an impact in Asian countries, and how Asian countries have in turn impacted Islam.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":2.97,"instructor_quality":3.263,"difficulty":2.823,"work_required":2.97,"credits":1.0},{"id":"WH-2050","title":"Entrepreneurial Communication","description":"In this course, students will learn communication frameworks and best practices for pitching innovative ideas in a way that persuades others to appreciate their value.

The first section (module) of the course, to be led by Professor Sil, will provide a broad overview of the evolution of global political economy across diverse historical eras, from the Industrial Revolution to the challenges of economic governance in the post-World War II era to the emergence of (and questioning of) the \"Washington Consensus\" in the post-Cold War era. Throughout, students will learn about varied developmental pressures and shifting international environments within which the relationships between markets and governments have been organized.  The second section (module), to be led by Professor Singh, will delve into the complex challenges and opportunities faced by firms and businesses operating on a global scale. With the aid of case studies, this section will address approaches to decisions and processes that affect the rise and fall of comparative advantage, while paying attention to evolving organizational structures, business strategies, the emergence of inter-firm networks and large business organizations, including multi-national corporations. In the third part of the course, students are expected to use what they learn and engage each other through the presentation of team projects on a major contemporary issue of global significance. These projects will incorporate discussion of some of the research being done by Penn faculty in the School of Arts & Sciences as well as the Wharton School, thereby helping to familiarize students with some of the disciplines and scholarly traditions covered in the two schools.

In addition to the other requirements it satisfies, this course may also be counted toward completion of the Psychoanalytic Studies minor (http:\/\/web.sas.upenn.edu\/psys\/). See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\nPsychoanalysis is not only a powerful therapeutic modality for numerous psychological stresses and disorders, it\u2019s also a comprehensive way of looking at the world: a way of understanding 1) the roles that emotions play in all aspects of our lives; 2) the enormous influence of childhood experiences and early development on our later friendships, romantic relationships, sexual experiences, and other personal, familial, cultural, and professional bonds; and 3) the rich and complex meanings of our social and aesthetic experiences (e.g., going to college, playing a sport, reading a book, taking a vacation, having a baby or a dog, creating a company or a garden, etc.). The theory and practice of psychoanalysis, from Sigmund Freud to the present day, is based fundamentally on the importance of unconscious processes and the complex ways in which those processes affect our lived experience: in childhood development and family relationships; in our wishes, dreams, and fantasies; in our experiences of work, play, love, sex, trauma, and loss; and in our creative, spiritual, and political strivings. Because the course aims to link the academic and the clinical, it will be team-taught by an academic faculty member and a practicing psychoanalyst. The course will introduce students to the broad and ever-expanding spectrum of psychoanalytic ideas and techniques, through reading and discussion of major works by some of its most influential figures, such as Freud, S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi, Melanie Klein, Heinz Kohut, Erik Erikson, D. W. Winnicott, Jacques Lacan, Wilfred Bion, John Bowlby, Stephen Mitchell, Jessica Benjamin, Nancy Chodorow, and Christopher Bollas. We will also read some literary, historical, philosophical, and anthropological works that have special relevance to the psychoanalytic exploration of the human condition. Indeed, the course will demonstrate how effective psychoanalytic ideas are in bridging a wide variety of disciplines in the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences\u2014including recent developments in neuropsychoanalysis. No prior knowledge of psychoanalysis is required, and interested students from all disciplines are warmly welcomed. The reading assignment for the second class meeting will be Alison Bechdel\u2019s graphic memoir, Are You My Mother?, if you want to get a head-start over Summer Break. Please note: in addition to the other requirements it satisfies, this course may also be counted toward completion of the Psychoanalytic Studies minor (http:\/\/web.sas.upenn.edu\/psys\/).

A third arose with cultural studies and reactions within anthropology to structuralism, including research on cross-cultural variation in the conceptualization of emotions. The course is appropriate for graduate students interested in exploring the linkages among these literatures, and who envision or are already actively undertaking research for which knowledge of them is pertinent.

The class will emphasize empirical research especially but not only quantitative research.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":2.804,"instructor_quality":3.047,"difficulty":2.208,"work_required":1.843,"credits":1.0},{"id":"LAW-9280","title":"International Arbitration","description":"International Arbitration","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":3.0},{"id":"MTR-6220","title":"Trends Medicine Vaccine","description":"Modern drug discovery has evolved to include human genetic diagnosis and various biological approaches which has enabled progress in a variety of fields, including rare diseases, immuno-oncology, precision medicine, and biomarkers.

You will create an oral history with a Philly-based community\nactivist, midwife, doula, or other practitioner whose work engages with\nreproductive justice, understood expansively as the right to have children, to\nnot have children, and to parent children in healthy environments free from\nviolence and state oppression. At the end of the class, we will release these\noral histories together as part of a new season of CEE\u2019s \u201cReckoning and Repair\nin Philadelphia\u201d podcast.\nRecent reports in Philadelphia have called particular attention to the severity of\nthe maternal health crisis in the city, where black birthing people are more than\nfour times as likely to die of preventable causes than their white peers. Such\ninequalities are not unique or new; Philadelphia was a crucial site where\nmedicine broadly and obstetrics more specifically were born\u2026 . Philadelphia is\nthe first city in the United States to have an obstetric society, and it is also the\neducational home of the so-called father of gynecology, James Marion Sims,\nwho notoriously experimented on enslaved women to develop foundational\nobstetric procedures still in use today.\nAt the same time, Philadelphia has also been an activist stronghold, as a site of\nhistorical Black, Caribbean, Latinx, and immigrant organizing and community\ncare for more than a century. Today, midwives, doulas, doctors, environmental\njustice workers and others continue to develope nurturing models of child,\nmaternal, and familial care that uplift communities. Many of these have been\ninformed by reproductive justice frameworks. Engaging with a long tradition of scholar-activist ethnography, we will turn to the experiences of these community organizers, birthworkers, midwives, and doulas to gain an understanding of their battles for reproductive justice in Philadelphia: from the persistent inequities in maternal medical care, to the community work to create safe neighborhoods, to patient rights education campaigns, to medical interventions within prisons. Working one-on-one with a partner engaged in this work, students will produce an oral history of reproductive justice in Philadelphia.\nIn the process students will learn crucial methods of critical medical\nanthropology, and build their skills in ethnographic listening as both a research\nmethod and a potentially transformative act of care. It is open to students with\nall levels of experience, including those with no prior background in\naudio\/media production\nThrough your podcast episodes, you'll answer the following questions:\n1. How have historical medical practices and medical cultures in\nPhiladelphia, especially in the context of clinical obstetric care, shaped\nthe current disparities and challenges in reproductive health?\n2. What cultural, social, and economic factors have influenced the\ndevelopment of homegrown methods of care within Philadelphia's\nreproductive justice community, and what do these practices provide\n(or avoid) that hospital practices do not?\n3. How do the experiences and perspectives of doula, reproductive justice\nworkers, and health practitioners intersect with or challenge\nestablished medical paradigms?\n4. What good does listening and documenting these stories of care and\nresistance in reproductive justice do, if anything, at the personal, social,\nand institutional level.\nThis course offers a unique, hands-on, real-world experience, enabling you to\ndevelop collaborative, ethical, and engaged work that contributes to\nPhiladelphia's reproductive justice community.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"NURS-7860","title":"Integration II: Midw Int","description":"Intensive integration of theory and clinical practice in women's health care with emphasis on intrapartum, postpartum, and newborn care.

Has the medieval Rus state been established by the Vikings or by the local Slavs? Is early Rus a mother state of Russia or of Ukraine, and, therefore, should it be spelled \u2018Kyivan Rus,\u2019 or \u2018Kievan Rus\u2019 in English? Has the culture of Russian political despotism been inherited from the Mongols, or is it an autochthonous ideology? The constructed past has a continuing importance in modern Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, and it is keenly referenced, often manipulatively, in contemporary social and political discourse. For example, President Putin invaded Ukraine under a pretense that its territory has \u201calways\u201d been an integral part of Russia and its history.\nThe course covers eight centuries of cultural, political, and social history of the lands that are now within the borders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, from early historical records through the 18th century, a period that laid the foundation for the Russian Empire and the formation of modern nations. Students gain knowledge about formative events and prominent figures, as well as social and cultural developments during this period.\nThe course takes multidisciplinary approach by combining the study of textual sources, objects of art and architecture, music, ritual, and film in their social and historical contexts. Students learn to analyze and interpret primary sources (historical documents and literary texts), identify their intellectual issues, and understand the historical, cultural, and social contexts in which these sources emerged. While working with these primary sources students learn to pose questions about their value and reliability as historical evidence. By exposing students to the critical examination of \u201cthe uses of the past,\u201d the course aims to teach them to appreciate the authoritative nature of historical interpretation and its practical application in contemporary social and political rhetoric. The study of pre-modern cultural and political history through the prism of nationalism theories explains many aspects of modern Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian societies, as well as political aspirations of their leaders. At the end of the course, students should develop understanding of the continuity and change in the history of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, their belief systems, and nationalistic ideologies, and will be able to speak and write about these issues with competence and confidence.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":2.88,"instructor_quality":3.087,"difficulty":2.583,"work_required":2.883,"credits":1.0},{"id":"COMM-8590","title":"Diversity & End of Avrg","description":"There are persistent inequities in academic experiences and careers between individuals from different demographic backgrounds.

A key challenge facing researchers is the interpretation of the vast amount of racial data generated by society. As these data do not directly answer important social questions, data analysis and statistics must be used to interpret them. The course will examine the logic used to communicate statistical results from racial data in various societies. We will question the scientific claims of social science methodology by extending the critical perspective to biases that may underlie research methods. We will discuss good and bad practices within the context of the historical developments of the methods.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"LAW-9210","title":"Law Seminar","description":"See Course Finder.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":3.0},{"id":"URBS-4000","title":"Senior Seminar","description":"Urban Studies senior research project","prerequisites":"","course_quality":2.408,"instructor_quality":3.215,"difficulty":3.001,"work_required":3.593,"credits":1.0},{"id":"ANTH-2460","title":"Molecular Anthropology","description":"In this course, we will explore the molecular revolution in biological anthropology.

Energy presents theoretical and practical challenges across many disciplines and professions, especially in the context of economic development and environmental sustainability at scales ranging from local to global. This course is intended to provide a broad overview of the institutions, legal frameworks, technologies, and markets involved in energy policy by exploring theories and case studies across these topics, with an emphasis on the energy transition necessitated by climate change. That said, a full introduction to energy policy requires multiple courses and Penn offers many salient ones across several schools including Law, Wharton, Weitzman, SAS, and SEAS. The primary goal of this course is to teach students how to think\u2014rather than what to know\u2014about energy policy. As such, this course provides both (a) a foundation for students who want to take additional courses on energy law, markets, technology, or policy and (b) a synthesis for students who have taken such courses and want to connect ideas and issues across disciplines and professions.

The internal structures, processes, and approach of philanthropy can work to break down these barriers or they can work to perpetuate these harms and injustices. The philanthropic sector has been actively reflecting and working on how best to breakdown these barriers and identify avenues to leverage their resources to support justice and equity. This course will aim to understand how the history of philanthropy has a direct impact on our current non-profit and public health landscape and infrastructure. The course will lift up contemporary discussions regarding the role of philanthropy in public health justice and power building. This course will also explore the role of philanthropy in changing systems as complex as early childhood education, food justice, and health care. Some of the questions this course will explore include: How do funders understand and define racial equity, racial justice, and power building? How do funders hold themselves accountable to transformative racial justice goals? What do public health justice activists what funders to know and change to increase effective and sustainable support for their work? How do funders center power-building in grantmaking? How are funders dismantling inequities in grantmaking processes and decision making? What is trust-based philanthropy? The role of intersectionality, race, and power in philanthropy? What is the difference between private, public, and corporate philanthropy? How can we leverage grantmaking tools and approaches, like communications, research, and evaluation, to center the voice and experience of those directly impacted? How do we transition from charity to justice?\nGuest lectures will include philanthropic experts working locally, nationally, and globally. In addition the course will highlight the voice of grassroot activists and organizers leveraging philanthropic investments to bring about social change.

See department website (under course tab) for current term course description: https:\/\/music.sas.upenn.edu\nIn 1971, musicologist Eileen Southern published The Music of Black Americans which became a definitive work in the field of Black music studies. Southern\u2019s work was groundbreaking as before the 1970s, several books and articles had been written on multiple forms of Black music including spirituals, blues, ragtime, jazz, concert music but relatively few of those works had been written by Black scholars or critics. Furthermore, many of these early writings did not accurately, objectively, or adequately describe the musical practices and values of African Americans. However, intense public\nand scholarly interest in Black culture after the Civil Rights Movement led to the scrutinization of earlier studies that failed to address the intricacies involved in understanding Black music aesthetics, traditions, cultures, and people. Accordingly, during the late-1960s and early-1970s, there was a flourishing in Black music research that embraced the study of Black life and culture in its totality\nleading to the formulation of new methodologies and theoretical models. Overall, the work from this period laid out important structures and themes for future research regarding African American music. In this course, inspired by the recent recovery work of musicologist Tammy Kernodle, we will trace the rise of a Black music intelligentsia and formation of a Black music scholarship infrastructure, particularly focusing on the transformative period of the late-twentieth century. Through the analysis of foundational scholarship that has contributed to the intellectual and ideological evolution of the field, we will explore the paradigm-shifting interventions made by music scholars such as Eileen Southern, Samuel A. Floyd, Jr., Portia Maultsby and many others. A particular emphasis will be placed on the establishment of Black music centers and academic journals, such as the Black Music Research Journal and The Black Perspective in Music, which have\nprofoundly influenced the framework of Black music scholarship. By exploring the establishment of Black music institutions and notable academic journals, we will gain insights into the systemic challenges and successes encountered in institutionalizing the study of Black music. Overall, the goal of this course is to deepen our understanding of the intellectual history of Black music studies and better understand how the work of the Black music intelligentsia not only infused the field with authenticity, care, joy, and rigor but also validated these qualities as legitimate scholarly expressions.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"JWST-1111","title":"Yiddish Lit. and Cult.","description":"This course introduces a variety of themes and genres in Yiddish literature and culture, depending on the instructor and programmatic needs.

The purpose of the course is to close the gap between the theory of business analytics and its actual practice, i.e., how you can really use it in your practice.\nMore than ever, there is a need for business leaders to become more data literate:\n\u201cBusiness leaders at every level need to become data literate and be able to understand data and analytical concepts that may have previously seemed out of reach, including statistical methods, machine learning, and data manipulation. With this spread of data literacy comes the powerful ability to make educated business decisions that rely on the smart use of data, rather than on an individual\u2019s opinions. In the past, these tasks were extremely complex and would be handed off to engineers. With the tools that exist today, business leaders are able to dive into their own analytics and uncover powerful insights.\u201d (Microsoft)\nYou will learn how to conduct in-depth business analytics based on sensible economics reasoning. As the main project, you will build an end-to-end business workflow. The problem and data can come from a current employer, from your own startup idea, or, from the instructor to represent a hypothetical setting. In the tradition of MGEC, the course will also motivate future electives to refine components of your analysis. Ultimately, you will walk away from the course with a fuller understanding of how different business and economics concepts \u201cfit together\u201d to answer big, relevant questions. Your new skillset is repeatable for your future projects. You will also learn key ideas that allow you to work with future coding teams in your future work, thereby closing the language gap between business economic goals and coding implementation.\nNormally, this type of comprehensive problem solving would require using coding languages like Python or R. However, the instructor for this course has developed a no-code toolbox that can be used with Microsoft Excel that allows for end-to-end analytics, making data analytics accessible to a much wider audience. This software will be provided for free to you.\nNOTICE TO MBA STUDENTS: MBA students must request enrollment for this class through Course Match and should not use the \"Add to Cart\" or \"Request Permission\" functions.

Bain & Company\u2019s Chris Zook put the matter ironically: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether organization is the new strategy, or strategy is the new organization, but it\u2019s something like that.\u201d Too often, however, these realms are treated as discrete. This course integrates strategy and organization through abstract thinking\u2014what psychologists call metacognition. You will gain both big-picture scope and nitty-gritty tools for organizational analysis, planning, and change. You will learn how to speed-read the literature on strategy, organization, leadership, management, and the like\u2014because so much of it is derivative and redundant. Old wine in new bottles. At the core of DYNM 6420 are five \u201ccognitive plays,\u201d or geometries of thinking: point, linear, curvilinear, angular, and triangular. Each play has its time and place. The challenge is to mix and match appropriately. Playbook shows how. The course is grounded in my most recent book, The Geometry of Strategy, and incorporates material from a book about metacognition that I am writing. In Rethinking the MBA (Harvard Business Press, 2010) Srikant Datar, David Garvin, and Patrick Cullen quote a representative executive (recruiter): We want people who can take an unstructured problem...and look at it in a completely different way. We want people who can x-ray [emphasis added] through to a different problem while using the same material everyone else has seen....We need people who can look at a problem and see it differently from others. [That way] you break the log jam. This course will enable you to x-ray strategic issues and problems in order to reveal their underlying logic. Most people instinctively think in point or linear terms. Point thinking is either\/or. Linear thinking is more of\/less of. Point thinking is effective for certain purposes; likewise, linear thinking. 1 Often there is little difference between point- and linear-thinking. The real contrast is between these two patterns and three more powerful kinds\u2014curvilinear, angular and triangular. Curvilinear thinking is like Goldilocks: finding a sweet spot that is \u201cnot too hot, not too cold.\u201d Angular thinking is what I call MBA-think: best-of-both-worlds\u2014the dominant form of cognition in leading graduate business schools. Triangular thinking goes beyond angular; it is finding parallels with the three interdependent variables that underlie almost every strategic organizational issue: autonomy, control, and cooperation. A Cognitive Playbook is high-concept, low-tech. It is not for everyone. This course will frustrate those who are (1) looking for a highly-structured educational experience, and\/or (2) uncomfortable with novelty and ambiguity. Put simply, DYNM 6420 upsets conventional modes of thinking\u2014but the payoff can be profound.

Enrollment is limited to 12 previously selected 12 EENT Fellows.  Prior to taking this course, EENT Fellows will have completed EAS5410 Engineering Entrepreneurship Fellows I in the spring semester and will have been immersed in a hands-on internship at a high-growth technology startup company in the summer semester.  During this summer internship, Fellows will have: (i) supported significant strategic initiatives at their startup; (ii) had one-on-one contact with top-level company leaders; (iii) kept and shared structured journals of their experiences; and (iv) hosted visits, in-person or remotely, of other Fellows to their startup companies to share experiences.  Throughout the 12-month Program, the Fellows will benefit from personal one-on-one mentoring by distinguished alumni, venture executives and investors.\nThe summer journal will be a pre-requisite assignment for EAS5430.   It will include the Fellows\u2019 observations and analysis of specific assignment topics within their respective companies which will, in turn, be shared and commented on by the other Fellows.  Assigned topics will include origins of the startup\u2019s innovative technology, intellectual property considerations, product-market fit, marketing strategy, business model, venture financing, management, handling adversity, scaling, culture, values, and principled leadership.  Journals will be maintained online allowing Fellows the opportunity to share and reflect on their own and their classmates\u2019 summer experiences with the objectives of: (a) comparing and discussing internship experiences; (b) exploring the elements of entrepreneurship; (c) compiling information useful for debriefing and case studies in EAS5430 in the fall; and (d) connecting the theory of EAS5410 with the realities of startups.\nIn EAS5430 Fellows will debrief their summer internship experiences with each other and faculty.  Drawing from knowledge, skills and frameworks acquired in EAS5410, as well as guidance from their mentors and their summer internship journal entries, each Fellow will prepare and deliver a presentation of their experience.  Executive leaders from each startup will be invited as guest speakers to present their perspective on the creation and growth of their respective companies.  Each Fellow will also prepare and present a case study focused on their observation and\/or involvement in a significant event, problem, or achievement of the company.

A hundred days without your own images:)  We will attempt instead to collectively and then sequentially author a set of video essays that engage with material that we are already deeply enmeshed in. That are typically too vast, \"thin\",  that either overflow or flow beneath representational or affective media. Examples of what we could make here would be: a video essay on the Wikileaks dataset of global US Embassy shopping lists, a film made from the Radia phone taps, and so on. This course draws on CAMP's learnings from running an open-access footage archive, Pad.ma and related projects, since 2007. Pad.ma asked: what is the ethical and political relation between the category footage (\"found\", shot in large quantities, with good intentions, left in shoe boxes or dying hard disks) and the category \"film\". Footage is the raw material, but does it also tell us how film is made, and whether it is beautiful on the inside.\nThat film is made from footage, seems tautological. But in the process we will follow, any simple relation between footage and film is shattered into a multitude of moves by imagers, sounders, writers, editors, narrators and materials.  We are inspired by Elizaveta Svilova, editor of \"Man with the Movie Camera\" carefully indexing, splicing and assembling pieces of film (intercutting them with images of women's work - patching phone lines, sewing, or painting fingernails), and that of her contemporary, Esfir Shub who was foraging cellars, gathering, restoring and compiling footage into films, a hundred years ago. Extending the footage metaphor to other media, we enter a vast terrain of over-collected materials. Health, insurance and other management databases, surveillance data, cctv streams, most of what the modern media industry is made of and which Matt Fuller and Andrew Goffey called Evil Media. Archive or be archived, we said in 2010. But the questions have moved beyond archival ones, to questions of what can be done with archives by situated subjects.\nWe begin by identifying footage collections or datasets that we can situate ourselves in, individually or as a group. We evolve narrative and editorial strategies within a Pad.ma - like interface via group annotations in a process called three-ing. In the second half of the course the participants develop a series of video essays. We see this as a counter-AI process of assimilation. At the end, we may also recognise that there are missing images - and if there is need for us to film, and if so why, with whom, and how. This prepares participants ethically and formally to go forth in the world to create really new images. The course is interdisciplinary and open to graduate students who have interests in film, ethnography, film studies, digital archives and contemporary art, and who like to work collectively and processually to realise ambitious projects.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"BBCB-5080","title":"Macromolecular Biophysics","description":"This course introduces students to the physical and chemical properties of biological macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids.

By reading William I. Robinson's The Global Police State [2020], we will examine the means and methods by which governments have policed this surplus humanity through mass incarceration, state and public surveillance, state violence, increased police powers, the militarized administration of immigration and refugees, and the permanent mobilization for war. To what extent do these forms of repression and social control secure the rule of the global capitalist system? Do those who benefit the most from the staggering levels of wealth inequality require such violent means to secure their interests? To what extent does this global police state function as an engine of generating profits and accumulating capital in a period of stagnating economic growth and the seeming ineluctable obsolescence of many kinds of labor? Does this system of social control require a conscious ruling agent, or can it function in the interests of the few without their direct control?

Legal interventions represent some of the most popular tools for increasing the quality and length of life. Law also plays an important role in structuring the delivery of health services including but not limited to the financing and regulation of health professionals working within hospitals and out in the community. This course introduces legal, ethical, and political concepts essential to the use of law and legal reform in promoting public health. Using current examples, the course introduces the authority of government to act, the limits on government action, and the legal and ethical implications when that authority and those limits collide. While exploring the tension between individual liberty and community health, it introduces the distinction between government action and inaction, the distribution of power and responsibility between levels and branches of government, and principles like consent.

You will create an oral history with a Philly-based community\nactivist, midwife, doula, or other practitioner whose work engages with\nreproductive justice, understood expansively as the right to have children, to\nnot have children, and to parent children in healthy environments free from\nviolence and state oppression. At the end of the class, we will release these\noral histories together as part of a new season of CEE\u2019s \u201cReckoning and Repair\nin Philadelphia\u201d podcast.\nRecent reports in Philadelphia have called particular attention to the severity of\nthe maternal health crisis in the city, where black birthing people are more than\nfour times as likely to die of preventable causes than their white peers. Such\ninequalities are not unique or new; Philadelphia was a crucial site where\nmedicine broadly and obstetrics more specifically were born\u2026 . Philadelphia is\nthe first city in the United States to have an obstetric society, and it is also the\neducational home of the so-called father of gynecology, James Marion Sims,\nwho notoriously experimented on enslaved women to develop foundational\nobstetric procedures still in use today.\nAt the same time, Philadelphia has also been an activist stronghold, as a site of\nhistorical Black, Caribbean, Latinx, and immigrant organizing and community\ncare for more than a century. Today, midwives, doulas, doctors, environmental\njustice workers and others continue to develope nurturing models of child,\nmaternal, and familial care that uplift communities. Many of these have been\ninformed by reproductive justice frameworks. Engaging with a long tradition of scholar-activist ethnography, we will turn to the experiences of these community organizers, birthworkers, midwives, and doulas to gain an understanding of their battles for reproductive justice in Philadelphia: from the persistent inequities in maternal medical care, to the community work to create safe neighborhoods, to patient rights education campaigns, to medical interventions within prisons. Working one-on-one with a partner engaged in this work, students will produce an oral history of reproductive justice in Philadelphia.\nIn the process students will learn crucial methods of critical medical\nanthropology, and build their skills in ethnographic listening as both a research\nmethod and a potentially transformative act of care.

How have historical medical practices and medical cultures in\nPhiladelphia, especially in the context of clinical obstetric care, shaped\nthe current disparities and challenges in reproductive health?\n2. What cultural, social, and economic factors have influenced the\ndevelopment of homegrown methods of care within Philadelphia's\nreproductive justice community, and what do these practices provide\n(or avoid) that hospital practices do not?\n3. How do the experiences and perspectives of doula, reproductive justice\nworkers, and health practitioners intersect with or challenge\nestablished medical paradigms?\n4. What good does listening and documenting these stories of care and\nresistance in reproductive justice do, if anything, at the personal, social,\nand institutional level.\nThis course offers a unique, hands-on, real-world experience, enabling you to\ndevelop collaborative, ethical, and engaged work that contributes to\nPhiladelphia's reproductive justice community.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"GRMN-0300","title":"Intermediate German I","description":"This course is designed to improve students writing and speaking competence, to increase vocabulary, to deepen grammar usage, and to help develop effective reading and listening strategies in German across literary genres and media as students interpret and analyze cultural, political, and historical moments in German-speaking countries and compare them with their own cultural practices.

Many of the most important business issues of today are global in nature. Both \"macro\" phenomena (e.g. nationalism, protectionism, demographic change) and \"micro\" trends (e.g. competition within and from emerging markets, distributed talent and innovation, digitization and automation) are inherently international issues. They require firms and managers to think, innovate, and organize globally.

Students will write weekly, chronicling and analyzing the twists and turns of campaign rhetoric, campaign ads, and media coverage; presidential debates will be grist for much of our writing. To learn more about this course, visit the Creative Writing Program at https:\/\/creative.writing.upenn.edu.\nBen Bradlee, a legendary Washington Post editor, once said that political journalism is \u201cthe first rough draft of history,\u201d an opportunity to report and write about the tumultuous civic life of this nation as it unfolds in real time. And it has rarely been as tumultuous as it is right now, with democracy itself on the ballot in the 2024 election. We live in an era when even the very definition of truth is widely under assault. And with the news cycle spinning faster than ever before, we will spend much of our time in this course time feeding off the news as it happens. National politics is a 24\/7 staple on streaming sites, social media, and in the minds of tens of millions of Americans who struggle to make sense of the news overload. Political journalists have a great challenge: seemingly by the hour, they are tasked with making smart judgments, supporting their analyses with empirical reportage, and communicating those judgments in clear language. They must cut through the clutter and engage the reader\u2014smartly and often entertainingly\u2014in a climate where journalists are derided in some circles as \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d They must respond in real time to events, statements, and upheavals that could never have been anticipated. The students in this course will be tasked to do the same, writing pieces that will be workshopped in class. We will also get the opportunity to air broader issues: Is traditionally objective \u201cboth sides\u201d journalism up to the task of watchdogging the newsmakers in an era when democracy itself is under serious threat? Is it feasible to provide \u201cbalanced\u201d coverage of two parties when many members of one party, starting with its likely presidential nominee, have been openly working to undermine democracy? This course, tracking a fast-moving presidential campaign, could not be more timely. Only true \u201cjunkies\u201d of national politics\u2014those who follow the news closely, and those who aspire to write about it\u2014are likely to love this course. At a time when Americans are more awash in political news than ever, the goal of this course is to help students master the craft of writing clear, responsible, incisive, substantive, and engaging political journalism\u2014and backing it up with factual research\/reporting. The hope is that students can live off the news and develop their \u201cearned voice\u201d via effective reporting, writing, and (most important of all) thinking.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":null,"instructor_quality":null,"difficulty":null,"work_required":null,"credits":1.0},{"id":"HSOC-1382","title":"Intro to Med Anthro","description":"Introduction to Medical Anthropology takes central concepts in anthropology -- culture, adaptation, human variation, belief, political economy, the body -- and applies them to human health and illness.

This course is designed to investigate the ways anthropology, as a discipline, emerged in conjunction with European (and later, American) imperialism, the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and the will to know and categorize difference across the world.

We then examine what studies of nonhuman primates (monkeys and apes) can reveal about our own evolutionary past, reviewing the behavioral and ecological diversity seen among living primates. We conclude the course examining the \"hard\" evidence of human evolution - the fossil and material culture record of human history from our earliest primate ancestors to the emergence of modern Homo sapiens - and also explore the new insights into modern human origins and dispersal provided by genetic studies. We will further examine the nature of human biological variation and discuss the history of scientific racism in physical anthropology.

We consider changing modes of production and reception, disciplinary and institutional innovations, animating debates, and global interdependencies and interchanges . Going well beyond iconic buildings and canonical \u201cisms,\u201d we pose the following questions: In what ways did the new architecture of the period respond to, participate in, and mediate the unprecedented experiences of modernizing societies? How did urban and environmental crises, colonial enterprises and devastating wars, national and international agendas, social changes, and technological advances affect architects\u2019 understanding of the spaces they were called upon to design? How, in turn, did buildings and projects reflect different societies\u2019 self-images and aspirations to become modern?

Moreover, consumer finance comprises an enormous sector of the economy, including products like credit cards, student loans, mortgages, retail banking, insurance, and a wide variety of retirement savings vehicles and investment alternatives. Additionally, recent breakthroughs in the FinTech arena are integrating innovative approaches to help consumers. Though virtually all people use these products, many find financial decisions to be confusing and complex, rendering them susceptible to fraud and deception. As a result, government regulation plays a major role in these markets. This course intended for Penn undergraduates considers economic models of household decisions and examines evidence on how consumers are managing (and mismanaging) their finances. Although academic research has historically placed more attention on corporate finance, household finance is receiving a brighter spotlight now-- partly due to its role in the recent financial crisis. Thus the course is geared toward those seeking to take charge of their own financial futures, anyone interested in policy debates over consumer financial decision making, and future FinTech entrepreneurs.","prerequisites":"","course_quality":2.321,"instructor_quality":2.505,"difficulty":1.991,"work_required":2.039,"credits":1.0},{"id":"BEPP-2500","title":"Managerial Economics","description":"This course will introduce you to \"managerial economics\" which is the application of microeconomic theory to managerial decision-making.
